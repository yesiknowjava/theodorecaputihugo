A study I co-authored with Dr. Eric Leas, Dr. Alicia Nobles, and others, which was published in _JAMA Network Open_, examined the meteoric rise in interest in cannabidiol (CBD) in the United States. The study was covered by news outlets including [Time](https://time.com/5710682/cannabis-marijuana-mental-health/), [USA Today](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/10/23/cbd-google-searches-cannabidiol-skyrocket-do-products-works/4062879002/) and [The Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7605455/CBD-Google-searches-surge-experts-call-snake-oil.html). My co-author Dr. John Ayers even discussed our findings on [Fox News with Laura Ingraham](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6097947941001/#sp=show-clips) (_note: personally not a Fox News fan_).

I am excited to share the findings of a recent paper I co-authored, which was published in _JAMA Internal Medicine_. Dr. Alicia Nobles, Dr. John Ayers, and I find a statistically significant increase in Google searches for sexual harassment and assault every week for our entire study period (8 months) after Alyssa Milano’s viral #MeToo Tweet on October 15, 2017. Importantly, searches for sexual harassment/assault preventive training and reporting were also increased. Read the study [here](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.5094) or press coverage in outlets such as [the LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-metoo-google-searches-20181221-story.html) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-metoo/more-google-searches-for-sexual-harassment-facts-since-metoo-idUSKCN1OK28L).

I was recently informed that I had the highest overall marks and the highest scoring dissertation in my MPH program. I was invited to present my dissertation at the School of Public Health’s annual Cameron Lecture. Because I’m living in the US, I delivered the presentation remotely ([you can download it from Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t0WEEZVxbCJ2b0cb7nQfw1UkgY1zRUxW/view?usp=sharing)), and the [poster](/files/thesis_poster.pdf) linked to my presentation won the Best Poster award.

I was a panelist in a webinar hosted by the University of California San Diego’s [Connected and Open Research Ethics Project](https://thecore.ucsd.edu/webinars/) on the use of Twitter data in public health studies. With co-authors Mark Dredze and Camille Nebeker, we spoke about [our paper published in npj Digital Medicine](https://www.theodorecaputi.com/publications/2018-Twitter-Ethics) finding that Tweets used in public health studies can often be used to reverse identify research subjects. The recording is available [here](https://youtu.be/HR8w3NKGaYo).

My first-authored paper on LGBQ suicide (_JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association_) was referenced in a tragic story of 9-year-old suicide in [Time Magazine](http://time.com/5380203/lgbtq-youth-suicide/). We hope our research will bring the health epidemic of LGBQ adolescents to light and inspire action among community members and policy-makers to avoid similar tragedies in the future.
