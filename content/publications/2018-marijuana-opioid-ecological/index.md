abstract: "Livingston et al.1 studied the state-level correlation between opioid overdose deaths and recreational marijuana legislation. In the articleâ€™s introduction, the authors claim that the study will contribute to the literature on â€œwhether cannabis is substituted for opioids in pain management,â€ and the reader is given the premise that â€œwith this substitution, an immediate reduction in opioid-related poisonings would be expected.â€ Therefore, those who read the studyâ€™s findingsâ€”that recreational marijuana legislation was followed by 0.7 fewer opioid overdose deaths statewide per monthâ€”are led to believe that the study constitutes evidence that pain-afflicted individuals in Colorado are substituting marijuana for opioids."
