abstract: "The purpose of this review is to examine theoretical connections between adolescentleadership education and problem behavior prevention. Both the problem behavior preventionliterature and the leadership education literature were reviewed for studies pertaining to thedevelopment of psychosocial traits. In the leadership education literature this research focused onthe development of leadership potential, as this was considered most closely linked withleadership education for adolescents as opposed to leadership education focused on honing skillsin established leaders. Because the purpose of this review was to determine if a theoreticalconnection exists between two previously unconnected fields of literature, a thorough literaturereview was conducted as opposed to a systematic review because it was deemed toocumbersome. Instead, salient studies from both fields were examined for their applicability to theother field and the analysis as a whole. The research found significant overlap in psychosocialprotective factors for problem behaviors and the psychosocial traits developed through leadershipeducation. This paper includes a review and synthesis of the two literatures, as well asdirect comparisons between them. Given that a theoretical connection between leadershipeducation and problem behavior prevention seems to exist, the author recommends empiricalresearch to determine if leadership education is an effective and efficient vehicle for problembehavior prevention. The paper will conclude with recommendations for leadership educationpractitioners, as well as other key stakeholders."
