abstract: "The purpose of this review is to examine theoretical connections between adolescent
leadership education and problem behavior prevention. Both the problem behavior prevention
literature and the leadership education literature were reviewed for studies pertaining to the
development of psychosocial traits. In the leadership education literature this research focused on
the development of leadership potential, as this was considered most closely linked with
leadership education for adolescents as opposed to leadership education focused on honing skills
in established leaders. Because the purpose of this review was to determine if a theoretical
connection exists between two previously unconnected fields of literature, a thorough literature
review was conducted as opposed to a systematic review because it was deemed too
cumbersome. Instead, salient studies from both fields were examined for their applicability to the
other field and the analysis as a whole. The research found significant overlap in psychosocial
protective factors for problem behaviors and the psychosocial traits developed through leadership
education. This paper includes a review and synthesis of the two literatures, as well as
direct comparisons between them. Given that a theoretical connection between leadership
education and problem behavior prevention seems to exist, the author recommends empirical
research to determine if leadership education is an effective and efficient vehicle for problem
behavior prevention. The paper will conclude with recommendations for leadership education
practitioners, as well as other key stakeholders."
