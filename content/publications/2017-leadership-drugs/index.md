abstract: "The purpose of this review is to examine theoretical connections between adolescent<br>leadership education and problem behavior prevention. Both the problem behavior prevention<br>literature and the leadership education literature were reviewed for studies pertaining to the<br>development of psychosocial traits. In the leadership education literature this research focused on<br>the development of leadership potential, as this was considered most closely linked with<br>leadership education for adolescents as opposed to leadership education focused on honing skills<br>in established leaders. Because the purpose of this review was to determine if a theoretical<br>connection exists between two previously unconnected fields of literature, a thorough literature<br>review was conducted as opposed to a systematic review because it was deemed too<br>cumbersome. Instead, salient studies from both fields were examined for their applicability to the<br>other field and the analysis as a whole. The research found significant overlap in psychosocial<br>protective factors for problem behaviors and the psychosocial traits developed through leadership<br>education. This paper includes a review and synthesis of the two literatures, as well as<br>direct comparisons between them. Given that a theoretical connection between leadership<br>education and problem behavior prevention seems to exist, the author recommends empirical<br>research to determine if leadership education is an effective and efficient vehicle for problem<br>behavior prevention. The paper will conclude with recommendations for leadership education<br>practitioners, as well as other key stakeholders."
