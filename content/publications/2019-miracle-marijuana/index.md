abstract: "For the past few years, one of the most popular topics in major journals and media outlets has been how medical marijuana use improves health outcomes 1. Studies have found that medical marijuana laws (MMLs) are responsible for a 25% decrease in opioid overdose rates 2, a 2.1% reduction in the probability of obesity 3, a 10–20% reduction in Medicaid and Medicare prescriptions 4, 5 and a 15% reduction in alcohol sales 6. In major news outlets, the study authors and reporters conclude that these findings are evidence of the healthful effects of medical marijuana use 7-9.
