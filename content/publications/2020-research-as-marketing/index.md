abstract: "Marijuana and marijuanabased medical products are now legally sold in 33 US states and most European Union countries.
Widespread medical marijuana legalization has ushered in an unprecedented level of investment in marijuana, replacing
small, independently owned storefronts with polished national and international corporations.As the industry has become more
sophisticated, so has its marketing; a recent commentary1 I coauthored in the Journal of the American Medical Association surveys Big Marijuana’s marketing strategy and summarizes how Big Marijuana companies convey poorly substantiated health claims to potential consumers."
