abstract: "Intelligent virtual assistants (IVA), such as Apples Siri, are transforming how the public seeks and finds information.1 IVAs are interfaces that enable users to interact with smart devices using spoken language in a natural way and provide a singular response to a query similar to speaking to a person.2 In contrast, traditional search engines return millions of relevant results to a query, relying on the user to collate the results and reach a conclusion. For example, querying whats the weather? on a search engine would return multiple links from different weather services, but an IVA is designed to return a singular resultthe current, local forecast."
