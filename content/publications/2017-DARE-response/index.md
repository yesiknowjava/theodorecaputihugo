abstract: "Intelligent virtual assistants (IVA), such as Apple’s Siri, are
transforming how the public seeks and finds information.1 IVAs
are interfaces that enable users to interact with smart devices
using spoken language in a natural way and provide a singular
response to a query similar to speaking to a person.2 In contrast,
traditional search engines return millions of relevant results to
a query, relying on the user to collate the results and reach a
conclusion. For example, querying “what’s the weather?” on a
search engine would return multiple links from different weather
services, but an IVA is designed to return a singular result—the
current, local forecast."
