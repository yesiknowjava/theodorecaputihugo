abstract: "Dr. Marsha Rosenbaumï¿½s recent opinion piece (2016)calling forï¿½reality-basedï¿½drug prevention and accom-panying prevention programï¿½Safety First: A RealityBased Approach to Teens and Drugsï¿½(Rosenbaum2014) prompts the question: what is reality?If social science is to be believed, researchers mustremove their subjective perception ofï¿½realityï¿½and turntheir attention to objective data. Rosenbaum claims thatharm reduction programs are effective because they arebased onï¿½reality,ï¿½and yet, thisï¿½realityï¿½is not based uponempirical data. The history of drug policy is riddled withexamples of policy and practice based on anecdotes orfaulty evidence, such as when states used draconian man-datory minimum sentencing laws intended to deter drugcrimes or when the U.S. turned a blind eye to over-pre-scribing pain medication. To learn from these mistakes,we must take an evidence-based approach to drug policy."
