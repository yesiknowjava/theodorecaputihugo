abstract: "Heat-not-burn tobacco products (HNB), including Reynolds American's (RA) ï¿½Eclipseï¿½ and ï¿½Revoï¿½ and Philip Morris International's (PMI) ï¿½Heatbarï¿½, are devices that heat tobacco to ?500ï¿½F, producing an inhalable aerosol. Since 1988, tobacco companies have perennially introduced HNB and marketed them as healthier than conventional cigarettes. These claims, refuted by researchers,1ï¿½failed to lure consumers. Each reincarnation of HNB was commercially unsuccessful, and most HNB products were discontinued shortly after their introduction. Until recently, HNB products were all but unavailable to consumersï¿½but now may be the perfect time for a thriving HNB market."
