Ac-cording to estimates from the Nation-al Survey on Drug Use and Health(NSDUH)  for  2013–15,  in  medicalmarijuana states, approximately 2.5 per-cent of Americans older than age twelveused  medical  marijuana  in  the  pastyear.1However, the authors’results im-ply that medical marijuana use—at least,licensed  use—is  much  less  commonthan the NSDUH reports. Within eigh-teen states studied for 2016, they foundjust 641,176 licensed medical marijuanausers (0.4 percent prevalence)."
