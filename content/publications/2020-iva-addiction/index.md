abstract: "We investigated how intelligent virtual assistants (IVA), including Amazonï¿½s Alexa, Appleï¿½s Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoftï¿½s Cortana, and Samsungï¿½s Bixby, responded to addiction help-seeking queries. We recorded if IVAs provided a singular response and if so, did they link users to treatment or treatment referral services. Only 4 of the 70 help-seeking queries presented to the five IVAs returned singular responses, with the remainder prompting confusion (e.g., ï¿½did I say something wrong?ï¿½). When asked ï¿½help me quit drugsï¿½ Alexa responded with a definition for the word drugs. ï¿½Help me quitï¿½smokingï¿½ or ï¿½tobaccoï¿½ on Google Assistant returned Dr. QuitNow (a cessation app), while on Siri ï¿½help me quit potï¿½ promoted a marijuana retailer. IVAs should be revised to promote free, remote, federally sponsored addiction services, such as SAMSHAï¿½s 1-800-662-HELP helpline. This would benefit millions of IVA users now and more to come as IVAs displace existing information-seeking engines."
