abstract: "We would first like to thank the Editors-in-Chief ofDrugs:Education, Prevention, and Policyfor the opportunityto respond to the Comment written by Drs. Hecht andMiller-Day.We contend our paper does not conclude that Keepinï¿½ itREAL is ineffective. The purpose of our paper is to answerthe question ï¿½ï¿½Is D.A.R.E.ï¿½s new Keepinï¿½ it REAL curriculumsuitable for American nationwide implementation,ï¿½ï¿½ and notï¿½ï¿½Has Keepinï¿½ it REAL been effective at curbing substanceuse in a randomized controlled trial(s).ï¿½ï¿½ As Hecht, Miller-Day, and their collaborators have shown in several studies(many of which are cited in our paper), the answer to the latterquestion is yes. Our paper, on the other hand, answers theformer question, with what we suggest is a healthy dose ofcaution, but not outright criticism."
