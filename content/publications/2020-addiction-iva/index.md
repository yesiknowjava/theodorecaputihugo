abstract: "We investigated how intelligent virtual assistants (IVA), including Amazons Alexa, Apples Siri, Google Assistant, Microsofts Cortana, and Samsungs Bixby, responded to addiction help-seeking queries. We recorded if IVAs provided a singular response and if so, did they link users to treatment or treatment referral services. Only 4 of the 70 help-seeking queries presented to the five IVAs returned singular responses, with the remainder prompting confusion (e.g., did I say something wrong?). When asked help me quit drugs Alexa responded with a definition for the word drugs. Help me quitsmoking or tobacco on Google Assistant returned Dr. QuitNow (a cessation app), while on Siri help me quit pot promoted a marijuana retailer. IVAs should be revised to promote free, remote, federally sponsored addiction services, such as SAMSHAs 1-800-662-HELP helpline. This would benefit millions of IVA users now and more to come as IVAs displace existing information-seeking engines."
