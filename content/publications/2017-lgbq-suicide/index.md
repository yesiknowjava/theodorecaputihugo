abstract: "Sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning) adolescents are believed to have elevated suicide risks.1 Studies supporting this claim, however, rarely use nationally representative samples, which is a major limitation given that stigma and prevention resources vary across communities and may influence suicide risk behaviors.2 When nationally representative studies are available, they are not recent.3 Moreover, studies have ignored the diversity among sexual minorities, assuming all share the same risks.4 We estimated suicide risk behaviors of sexual minority adolescents using nationally representative data from 2015."
