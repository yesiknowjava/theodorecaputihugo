abstract: "25 July 2021 will mark the second anniversary of the e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) outbreak. The concerns raised and news media attention focused on EVALI created a fertile environment for the tobacco industry to promote their e-cigarette alternatives, but this has not been studied."
