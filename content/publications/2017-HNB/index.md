abstract: "Heat-not-burn tobacco products (HNB), including Reynolds American’s (RA) ‘Eclipse’ and ‘Revo’ and Philip Morris International’s (PMI) ‘Heatbar’, are devices that heat tobacco to ∼500°F, producing an inhalable aerosol. Since 1988, tobacco companies have perennially introduced HNB and marketed them as healthier than conventional cigarettes. These claims, refuted by researchers,1 failed to lure consumers. Each reincarnation of HNB was commercially unsuccessful, and most HNB productswere discontinued shortly after their introduction."
