abstract: "Cannabidiol (CBD) is widely promoted as a panacea. For example, the cannabis brand MedMen claims CBD treats acne, anxiety, opioid addiction, pain, and menstrual problems.1 However, the US Food and Drug Administration has only approved highly purified CBD (Epidiolex) for treating epilepsy. To our knowledge, there is currently no population-focused surveillance of public interest in CBD. Consequently, many question whether CBD should be prioritized by public health leaders and regulators. This article describes public interest in CBD within the United States."
