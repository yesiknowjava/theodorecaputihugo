abstract: "For the past few years, one of the most popular topics in major journals and media outlets has been how medical marijuana use improves health outcomesï¿½1. Studies have found that medical marijuana laws (MMLs) are responsible for a 25% decrease in opioid overdose ratesï¿½2, a 2.1% reduction in the probability of obesityï¿½3, a 10ï¿½20% reduction in Medicaid and Medicare prescriptionsï¿½4,ï¿½5ï¿½and a 15% reduction in alcohol salesï¿½6. In major news outlets, the study authors and reporters conclude that these findings are evidence of the healthful effects of medical marijuana useï¿½7-9."
