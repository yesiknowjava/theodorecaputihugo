abstract: "Dr. Marsha Rosenbaums recent opinion piece (2016) calling for reality-based drug prevention and accompanying prevention program Safety First: A Reality Based Approach to Teens and Drugs (Rosenbaum 2014) prompts the question: what is reality? If social science is to be believed, researchers must remove their subjective perception of reality and turn their attention to objective data. Rosenbaum claims that harm reduction programs are effective because they are based on reality, and yet, this reality is not based upon empirical data. "
