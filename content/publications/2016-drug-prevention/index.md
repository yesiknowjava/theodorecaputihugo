abstract: "Dr. Marsha Rosenbaum’s recent opinion piece (2016)
calling for “reality-based” drug prevention and accompanying prevention program “Safety First: A Reality
Based Approach to Teens and Drugs” (Rosenbaum
2014) prompts the question: what is reality?
If social science is to be believed, researchers must
remove their subjective perception of “reality” and turn
their attention to objective data. Rosenbaum claims that
harm reduction programs are effective because they are
based on “reality,” and yet, this “reality” is not based upon
empirical data. "
