abstract: "Kevin Boehnke and coauthors (Feb 2019) describe the indications of licensed medical marijuana users in several states and compare those indications to evidence of efficacy. According to estimates from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) for 201315, in medical marijuana states, approximately 2.5 percent of Americans older than age twelve used medical marijuana in the past year.1"
