abstract: "Substance abuse prevention programs can be a tough sell to schools, but by employing
common business frameworks, the field can more easily understand the state of the field
and identify possible methods of expanding school-based substance abuse
prevention. An analysis of the state of the substance abuse prevention field finds that the
field often fails to consider the consumer when making strategic business decisions.
Consumer-driven approaches such as the development and adoption of a standardized
measure for effectiveness of in-school substance abuse prevention programs may expand
the use and impact of substance abuse prevention. The field should extensively examine
the current state of substance abuse prevention, through business tools such as the SWOT
and Five C’s Analysis, before ultimately developing a strategy. The prevention field can
learn from business practices."
