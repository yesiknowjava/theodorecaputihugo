abstract: "Substance abuse prevention programs can be a tough sell to schools, but by employing<br>common business frameworks, the field can more easily understand the state of the field<br>and identify possible methods of expanding school-based substance abuse<br>prevention. An analysis of the state of the substance abuse prevention field finds that the<br>field often fails to consider the consumer when making strategic business decisions.<br>Consumer-driven approaches such as the development and adoption of a standardized<br>measure for effectiveness of in-school substance abuse prevention programs may expand<br>the use and impact of substance abuse prevention. The field should extensively examine<br>the current state of substance abuse prevention, through business tools such as the SWOT<br>and Five C’s Analysis, before ultimately developing a strategy. The prevention field can<br>learn from business practices."
