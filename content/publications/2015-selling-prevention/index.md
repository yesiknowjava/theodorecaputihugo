abstract: "Substance abuse prevention programs can be a tough sell to schools, but by employingcommon business frameworks, the field can more easily understand the state of the fieldand identify possible methods of expanding school-based substance abuseprevention. An analysis of the state of the substance abuse prevention field finds that thefield often fails to consider the consumer when making strategic business decisions.Consumer-driven approaches such as the development and adoption of a standardizedmeasure for effectiveness of in-school substance abuse prevention programs may expandthe use and impact of substance abuse prevention. The field should extensively examinethe current state of substance abuse prevention, through business tools such as the SWOTand Five C’s Analysis, before ultimately developing a strategy. The prevention field canlearn from business practices."
