abstract: "One in eight of the 1.2 million Americans living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are unaware of their positive status, and untested individuals are responsible for most new infections. As a result, testing is the most cost-effective HIV prevention strategy and must be accelerated when opportunities are presented. Web searches for HIV spiked around actor Charlie Sheenâ€™s HIV-positive disclosure. However, it is unknown whether Sheenâ€™s disclosure impacted offline behaviors like HIV testing. The goal of this study was to determine if Sheenâ€™s HIV disclosure was a record-setting HIV prevention event and determine if Web searches presage increases in testing allowing for rapid detection and reaction in the future. Sales of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV test kits in the USA were monitored weekly from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, alongside Web searches including the terms â€œtest,â€ â€œtests,â€ or â€œtestingâ€ and â€œHIVâ€ as accessed from Google Trends. Changes in OraQuick sales around Sheenâ€™s disclosure and prediction models using Web searches were assessed. OraQuick sales rose 95% (95% CI, 75â€“117; p < 0.001) of the week of Sheenâ€™s disclosure and remained elevated for 4 more weeks (p < 0.05). In total, there were 8225 more sales than expected around Sheenâ€™s disclosure, surpassing World AIDS Day by a factor of about 7. Moreover, Web searches mirrored OraQuick sales trends (r = 0.79), demonstrating their ability to presage increases in testing. The â€œCharlie Sheen effectâ€ represents an important opportunity for a public health response, and in the future, Web searches can be used to detect and act on more opportunities to foster prevention behaviors."
