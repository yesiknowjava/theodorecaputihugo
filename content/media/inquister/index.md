article: Charlie Sheen is widely remembered for his highly publicized womanizing,
  drinking, and drug problems. Presently aged 51, he has on many occasions made headlines
  with his controversial remarks and behavior. He recently cited borderline dementia
  brought about by his "old" HIV medication as one of the main causes for his erratic
  behavior. The following was his statement in relation to this while speaking to
  a crowd of 300 people at Hollywood Roosevelt. "[The drugs] kept me suppressed and
  alive, but I struggled with a constant migraine and at times, borderline dementia.
  I've started to feel back to myself again and back in touch with all aspects of
  my life. When I was first diagnosed, I knew it wasn't a death sentence but it was
  just a giant frickin' bummer. I accept the gift of being alive. I could run and
  hide from this whole thing and not be outspoken and honest and open about it, but
  I've chosen a path that's the opposite." "What's striking is that Sheen's public
  disclosure increased sales of HIV home-testing kit OraQuick almost eight times more
  than after long-running awareness campaign World AIDS Day, which has been held every
  December 1 since 1988." "San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health
  research professor John W. Ayers headed the research that analyzed Google search
  data, which found that there were millions of searches on HIV prevention and testing
  after Sheen discussed his illness. Notable was that there was no call on HIV awareness
  at that time from either Sheen or public health leaders. The study was published
  in JAMA Internal Medicine." "Ayers and his team then analyzed search queries and
  sales of home-testing kit OraQuick within the United States. They found that there
  was a correlation between the online searches on HIV and testing to the number of
  home-testing kits purchased. OraQuick is an oral swab test and is the "only rapid
  in-home HIV test kit available in the United States,'" my favorite Robin yet (c)[?]

  He was worth well over $125 million at one time and threw it all away. Expensive
  planes, drugs, women -- then payoffs. Now, Charlie can't even find work. No one
  wants to hire him. Charlie is grateful that his wives have cut their demands for
  child support, but he may not be able to afford any child support much longer."
  "It's a case of how the mighty have fallen. Charlie is so down on his luck and flat
  broke that is has lowered himself to making appearances with other also-rans of
  TV fame at the Wizard World shows which fans attend to get celebrity autographs."
  His activities and speeches as pertaining to HIV awareness are said to have contributed
  to a significant increase in the use of HIV testing kits. In 2015, when he revealed
  to the world that he was HIV-positive, researchers apparently observed that there
  was a significant increase in the use of HIV home test kits and related online searches.
  The following is an excerpt of the report on this by the Inquirer.Charlie Sheen
  was, however, recently reported to be broke. The actor once commanded $1.8 million
  an episode. However, his spending habits and the millions he apparently paid out
  to people close to him to keep quiet about his HIV diagnosis was apparently too
  much. In September last year, Radar reported that the actor had moved into his parents'
  home in Malibu. This is according to a source who spoke to the site. This is what
  he revealed about the actor.In a most recent report by the site, the Anger Management
  actor is also paid to make appearances. This is also according to an insider. The
