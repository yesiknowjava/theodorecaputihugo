article: The federal government should more aggressively regulate the marketing of
  marijuana, particularly products that feature unsubstantiated health claims, three
  UC San Diego physicians say in the latest issue of Journal of the American Medical
  Association (JAMA). A viewpoint column written by Drs. John W. Ayers Jr., Theodore
  Caputi, and Eric C. Leas said that misleading advertising can be found throughout
  the for-profit marijuana industry. But the three physicians were especially critical
  of MedMen Enterprises,a Culver City-based company that operates in many states,
  and in many cities, including San Diego. "Health and medicine are implied in the
  name of this company, even though a majority of MedMens stores sell recreational
  marijuana," the physicians state in the viewpoint article. Advertisement "Billboards
  read, 'Heal. Its legal. The companys blog, Ember, has an entire section dedicated
  to health, including a claim that marijuana 'can reduce anxiety, pain, and so much
  more, a physicians recommended list of marijuana products for menstrual cramps,
  and promotion of marijuana as a safe, natural, and non-addictive alternative to
  prescriptions, even implying that marijuana can treat opioid addiction, an opinion
  with which experts disagree." The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has the authority
  to police unsubstantiated product claims, and has done so in a modest number of
  instances involving marijuana. In late 2017, the FDA notified the public to beware
  of fraudulent advertising, pointing to companies that had claimed that cannabis
  can be used to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure cancer. "Thats not enough," Ayers
  told the Union-Tribune. "The FDA doesnt enforce this aggressively. We need more
  effective regulations about health claims, and ads that are meant to appeal to children."
  MedMen notes on its website that the advertising it does for products like marijuana
  and for CBD, a cannabis derivative, are statements that have "not been evaluated
  by the FDA. (They are) not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."
  In California, it is lawful for people 21 and older to possess, own, and use marijuana,
  and to grow limited amounts of cannabis. However, the medicinal value of marijuana
  has not been clearly established. Many doctors, including some at UC San Diego Health,
  prescribe cannabis to help some patients cope with chronic pain. And UCSD is currently
  doing a small clinical trial to see if CBD can alleviate severe autism in children.
  But the National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine said in a landmark
  report in 2017 that it remains largely unclear whether marijuana can be broadly
  used through medicine to treat various problems -- primarily because the drug has
  not been widely studied.
