summary: 'A new study found 25% of gay, lesbian and bi teens reporting they attempted
  suicide in the last year. Gay Teens Are Four Times More Likely To Attempt SuicideSuicide
  has long been an issue for LBGT youth, but a new study finds that theyre four times
  as likely to try to take their own lives than their hetero peers. The results, published
  in JAMA, underscores the crisis in LGBT youth suicide: 25% of the teens who identified
  as gay, lesbian, bisexual or questioning reported a suicide attempt in the last
  year, as compared to just 6% of heterosexuals. Researchers out of the University
  of Nevada recently reported that gay, lesbian, bisexual and questioning youth who
  reported at least one adverse childhood experience ((ACE) were seven times more
  likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual students. More than half of LGB students
  reported at least two ACEs, which raises their odds of attempting suicide to 13
  times that of their straight peers.'
