article: Play video content TMZ.com Charlie Sheen's not willing to take all the credit,
  but understands his HIV diagnosis likely played a huge part in boosting sales of
  home HIV test kits. Researchers are calling it the "Sheen Effect," and Charlie was
  fully aware of the numbers when we saw him Monday morning at a Malibu gas station.
  By some counts, HIV test sales jumped up to 95% immediately after his 2015 announcement
  -- and remained as high as 60% up to a month later. Charlie's take -- "It's exciting,
  and it's great to be of service at that level." He also explained how his life has
  not only changed, but has "been elevated in a lot of ways."
