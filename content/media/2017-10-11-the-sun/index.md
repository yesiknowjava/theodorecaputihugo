  no e-cig. Hailed as a "healthier" alternative to traditional fags, the heat-not-burn
  devices are set explode in popularity, experts said today. 5 Heat-not-burn devices

  officials who were "caught off guard" by e-cigarettes, to get clued up now and set
  the agenda rather than wait for the tobacco giants to get their first. Campaign
  group ASH said due to the tobacco industry''s "long record of deceit over the health
  risks of smoking", there''s an "urgent need" for more research into these new devices.
  As with many e-cigs, the devices are made and sold by the big tobacco companies,
  eager not to lose business as more and more people stub out their habit. The new
  method gently heats tobacco to a balmy 260C to produce a tobacco vapour. 5 They

  only contain nicotine, don''t Credit: Getty - Contributor Dr John Ayers, an associate
  research professor at the San Diego State University, said they appeal to smokers
  who still demand the "throat-hit" delivered by a regular cigarette, but not by most
  e-cigs. That''s because e-cigarettes vapourise nicotine - the addictive part of
  a cigarette - but don''t contain any tobacco. Now a new study, led by Dr Ayers,
  looks at the potential new fad. Heat-not-burn devices are currently only on sale
  in a handful of places around the world, and so little is known about their appeal.

  Contributor The first device became available in the UK in November last year. Dr
  Ayers and his team turned to Google, to look at search trends relating to the products
  in Japan - the first country to sell them. Their findings showed a huge surge in
  demand for the heat-not-burn devices - rising by 2,956 per cent in the two years
  from 2015 to 2017. The study''s co-author, Professor Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins
  University in Baltimore, said: "Heat-not-burn products have quickly become insanely
  popular. From what we know so far, it is likely heat-not-burn products are less
  harmful than smoking, but more harmful than electronic cigarettes Deborah Arnott,
  ASH "Two years ago there were essentially no enquiries in Japan for heat-not-burn
  tobacco, but now there are between 5.9 and 7.5 million each month." And the team
  noted interest in the heat-not-burn devices in Japan is growing faster than it did
  for e-cigs, when they first hit the market. The study authors added: "This suggests
  that as heat-not-burn tobacco is introduced in new markets, its popularity may even
  eclipse e-cigarettes." But the researchers urged public health officials to get
  clued up now, after many were taken by surprise by the surge in demand for e-cigs.

  Dr Theodore Caputi, from the University of Pennsylvannia, said tobacco firms are
  constantly "trying to outmanoeuvre public health protections" by creating new products
  "that make tobacco appear less dangerous and more appealing". He said: "People were
  caught off guard by e-cigarettes, for example. "Our study is an early warning and
  a call to action for public health professionals to address heat-not-burn products
  now." Deborah Arnott, chief executive of ASH, agreed and said until more independent
  research is done, heat-not-burn products must face the same strict regulation as
  cigarettes. She told The Sun Online: "From what we know so far, it is likely heat-not-burn
  products are less harmful than smoking, but more harmful than electronic cigarettes.
  "However, unless and until independent evidence shows that these products are substantially
  less harmful than smoking, they should be regulated in the same way as other tobacco
  products. "Fully independent research and assessment will be crucial if heat-not-burn
  tobacco products are to be accepted as useful in fighting the smoking epidemic."
  In the UK alone smoking kills nearly 100,000 people each year. And globally in the
  20th century the habit claimed the lives of 100 million people - more than World
  Wars I and II combined. 5 Experts urged public health officials to act now to set
  the agenda on heat-not-burn products, before the tobacco giants get their first
  Credit: Getty - Contributor Eric Leas, from Stanford Unversity, echoed Ms Arnott''s
  call for further studies, adding: "There''s a tremendous amount we need to learn
  about heat-not-burn tobacco." As did Joanna Cohen, from the Johns Hopkins Institute
  for Global Tobacco Control. She said big questions remain over the device''s potential
  to harm a smoker''s health, and added they should be subject to the same harsh restrictions
  as cigarettes. "Given heat-not-burn is a tobacco product, all existing policies
  to protect the public from other tobacco products should be enforced," she said.

  Dr Ayers added: "Tobacco control is at a new crossroads. "Leaders can reasonably
  respond to this new data and ready themselves by setting an agenda or wait for big
  tobacco to set the heat-not-burn agenda for them." A study published this summer
  found e-cigarettes do help smokers quit - and more should switch to vaping for the
  sake of their health. But, like with these new products, experts have warned more
  research is needed to determine the safety of e-cigs. Another piece of research
  found just one puff of a e-cigarettes could increase a vaper''s risk of heart attack.
  Public Health England and the Royal College of Physicians believe it is in the interests
  of public health to promote the use of e-cigs as a way to encourage smokers to quit.
  The new findings are published today in the journal PLOS One. Responding to the
  study, Peter Nixon, MD of Philip Morris Limited, hailed the findings "encouraging".
  "We agree with the study authors that smokers should have access to accurate, scientifically
  substantiated information about the relative risk of different tobacco and nicotine
  products so that they can make informed choices," he told The Sun Online. "Encouraging
  smokers who would otherwise continue to use cigarettes to instead switch to less
  risky alternatives is an important strategy that can complement existing tobacco
  control measures."'

  fags, campaigners warn. ASH called for more research into the safety of the products,
  which sit somewhere between cigarettes and e-cigs, delivering a lower level of tobacco
  than regular ciggies.
