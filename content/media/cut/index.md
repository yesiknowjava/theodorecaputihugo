summary: But there are exceptions to that rule, and one of the more interesting classes
  of exceptions occurs when theres a big, high-profile event that focuses a lot of
  media attention on a particular problem. It was one of those media events that focused
  a huge amount of attention on one public figure and one very important public-health
  issue. A few months later, in a JAMA Internal Medicine study that Science of Us
  covered, Ayers and his colleagues found that Sheens announcement appeared to have
  caused a massive uptick in Google searches pertaining to HIV testing and condoms.
  Rather than just examine search-term volume, the researchers looked at sales data
  for OraQuick, which is apparently the only rapid-result HIV testing kit available
  in the United States. And it lends a lot of credence to the idea that some high-profile
  events really can cause massive, albeit probably temporary, changes in behavior
  -- sometimes, as in this case, life-saving ones.
