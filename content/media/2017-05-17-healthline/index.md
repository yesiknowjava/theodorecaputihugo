  <p>When actor Charlie Sheen <a href="http://www.today.com/popculture/charlie-sheen-revealing-hiv-status-was-getting-out-prison-t99661">announced</a>
  his HIV-positive status on NBC&rsquo;s Today Show, the world listened in stunned
  silence.</p>

  <p>Scientists are now investigating the influence of his disclosure on levels of
  HIV testing.</p>

  <p>About 1.2 million people in the United States are currently living with HIV.
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that, of those, <a
  href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/statistics.html">1 in 8</a> do not know that
  they have the disease.</p>

  <p>Because of the stigma attached to HIV, any event that prompts people to get tested
  must be capitalized upon, officials say.</p>

  <p>Charlie Sheen&rsquo;s television declaration was one such event.</p>

  <p>Sheen found fame acting in such films as &ldquo;Platoon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Young
  Guns&rdquo; as well as the television series &ldquo;Two and a Half Men&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;Spin City.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Following his interview in November 2015, Sheen became one of the most prominent
  celebrities who is publicly HIV-positive.</p>

  <p>His interview preceded a huge spike in online search queries for topics regarding

  awareness campaigns the &lsquo;Charlie Sheen effect&rsquo; is astonishing,&rdquo;
  said study co-author Benjamin Althouse of the Institute of Disease Modeling.</p>

  <p>The increase in OraQuick sales was a surprising seven times larger than the sales
  usually associated with World AIDS Day &ndash; the largest and longest-running HIV
  prevention awareness event.</p>

  <p>The sales volumes mirrored the Internet traffic.</p>

  <p>In fact, when the researchers estimated OraQuick sales using the Google data
  alone, they were able to predict sales figures to within 7 percent for any particular
  week.</p>

  <p>This in itself is a significant finding. Ayers explains its importance:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Public health leaders are often cautious, choosing to wait for traditional
  data instead of taking reasonable action in response to novel data, like Internet
  searches. Our findings underscore the value of big media data for yielding rapid
  intelligence to make public health actionable and more responsive to the public
  it serves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Going forward and armed with these findings, public health bodies need to be
  ready to ride the wave of interest as and when it occurs.</p>

  <p>The authors believe that the surge in sales following Sheen&rsquo;s announcement
  may be due to empathy.</p>

  <p>Co-author Jon-Patrick Allem, from the University of Southern California Keck
  School of Medicine in Los Angeles, interprets the results:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our findings build on earlier studies that suggest empathy is easier to
  motivate others when the empathy is targeted toward an individual versus a group.
  [&hellip;] It is easy to imagine that a single individual, like Sheen, disclosing
  his HIV status may be more compelling and motivating for people than an unnamed
  mass of individuals or a lecture from public health leaders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Because Internet search data are publicly available and accessible in almost
  real-time, they could provide a useful tool for any group promoting health issues.</p>

  <p>By responding to future events similar to Sheen&rsquo;s interview, an even greater
  positive influence might be achieved.</p>'
