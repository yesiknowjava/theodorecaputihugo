summary: Research on Charlie Sheens disclosure of being HIV-positive shows how star
  power can influence people--up to increasing awareness on public health. When actor
  Charlie Sheen publicly revealed he was HIV-positive last November 17, 2015, researchers
  found that there was an uptick in both online searches on HIV and in sales of home-testing
  kits. Notable was that there was no call on HIV awareness at that time from either
  Sheen or public health leaders. They found that there was a correlation between
  the online searches on HIV and testing to the number of home-testing kits purchased.
  OraQuick sales almost doubled following Sheens public admission and "8,225 more
  sales than expected" was recorded in the three weeks after.
