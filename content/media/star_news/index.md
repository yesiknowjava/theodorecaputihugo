summary: 'For the study, researchers monitored the volume of Google searches originating
  in the US from Jan 1, 2010 through June 15, 2018 related to sexual harassment and
  assault. During the last eight months of the study period - after #MeToo began -
  there were 40 to 54 million Google searches related to sexual harassment or assault,
  the greatest number of searches on this topic ever recorded in the US, the study
  found. Searches related specifically to reporting sexual harassment and assault
  were 30% higher than expected over the last eight months of the study. And searches
  related to preventive training for sexual harassment and assault were 51% higher
  than expected. These results suggest that #MeToo may have reduced the stigma of
  reporting or discussing sexual harassment and assault, the authors conclude.'
