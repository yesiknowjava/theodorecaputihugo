  -- Virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri are little help for people seeking information
  about how to quit drinking, smoking, vaping or taking opioids, a new study finds.
  "Alexa can already fart on demand, why can't it and other intelligent virtual assistants
  also provide lifesaving substance use treatment referrals for those desperately
  seeking help? Many of these same people likely have no one else to turn to except
  the smart device in their pocket," said study co-leader John Ayers. He's an associate
  adjunct professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego's Qualcomm
  Institute. About half of U.S. adults use virtual assistants, and some manufacturers
  plan to introduce health care advice, including personalized recommendations. The
  new study -- published online Jan. 29 in the journal NPJ Digital Medicine -- investigated
  whether virtual assistants already provide useful information about substance use.
  "One of the dominant health issues of the decade is the nation's ongoing addiction
  crisis, notably opioids, alcohol and vaping. As a result, it is an ideal case study
  to begin exploring the ability of intelligent virtual assistants to provide actionable
  answers for obvious health questions," Ayers said in a journal news release.

  <p>TUESDAY, Feb. 4, 2020 (HealthDay News) -- Virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri
  are little help for people seeking information about how to quit drinking, smoking,
  vaping or taking opioids, a new study finds.</p>

  <p>&quot;Alexa can already fart on demand, why can''t it and other intelligent virtual
  assistants also provide lifesaving substance use treatment referrals for those desperately
  seeking help? Many of these same people likely have no one else to turn to except
  the smart device in their pocket,&quot; said study co-leader John Ayers. He''s an
  associate adjunct professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego''s
  Qualcomm Institute.</p>

  <p>About half of U.S. adults use virtual assistants, and some manufacturers plan
  to introduce health care advice, including personalized recommendations.</p>

  <p>The new study -- published online Jan. 29 in the journal <i>NPJ Digital Medicine</i>
  -- investigated whether virtual assistants already provide useful information about
  substance use.</p>

  <p>&quot;One of the dominant health issues of the decade is the nation''s ongoing
  addiction crisis, notably opioids, alcohol and vaping. As a result, it is an ideal
  case study to begin exploring the ability of intelligent virtual assistants to provide
  actionable answers for obvious health questions,&quot; Ayers said in a journal news
  release.</p>

  <p>For the study, the researchers asked Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant,
  Microsoft Cortana and Samsung Bixby to &quot;help me quit&quot; various substances,
  including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and opioids.</p>

  <p>In response to 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants offered
  &quot;actionable responses&quot; only four times. The most common response was confusion,
  the investigators found.</p>

  <p>Of the queries that yielded a response: &quot;help me quit drugs&quot; on Alexa
  returned a definition for drugs; &quot;help me quit smoking&quot; and &quot;help
  me quit tobacco&quot; on Google Assistant returned the smoking cessation app QuitNow;
  and &quot;help me quit pot&quot; on Siri returned a promotion for a marijuana retailer.</p>

  <p>Despite their findings, the study authors said that virtual assistants have the
  potential to provide meaningful help to people seeking help for addiction.</p>

  <p>Study co-leader Alicia Nobles, a postdoctoral scholar at the institute, said,
  &quot;Thanks to free federally managed remote substance-misuse treatment or treatment
  referral services, like 1-800-662-HELP for alcohol or drugs and 1-800-QUIT-NOW for
  smoking or vaping, we can encourage people to take the first step towards treatment
  by having intelligent virtual assistants promote 1-800 helplines.&quot;</p>

  <p>She noted that only 10% of Americans who need treatment for substance misuse
  receive it.</p>

  <p>&quot;Because intelligent virtual assistants return the optimal answer to a query,
  they can provide a huge advantage in disseminating resources to the public,&quot;
  Nobles said. &quot;Updating intelligent virtual assistants to accommodate help-seeking
  for substance misuse could become a core and immensely successful mission for how
  tech companies address health in the future.&quot;</p>
