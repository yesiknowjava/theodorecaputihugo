summary: A team of Australian researchers analyzed the results of 83 prior studies
  that looked at medicinal cannabinoids effects on mental health and neurological
  conditions, including depression, anxiety, Tourette syndrome, ADHD, PTSD and psychosis.
  Marijuana could, for example, lessen chronic pain or nausea, which then leads to
  a reduction in mental health symptoms. Plus, many people arent using pharmaceutical-grade
  cannabinoids, and a body of research suggests non-medicinal cannabis use can worsen
  mental health symptoms, the authors note. The THC and CBD products available to
  most consumers are also notoriously under-regulated. The review also exposed just
  how little research has been done on cannabinoids and mental health.
