  Sheen announced his HIV-positive status on NBCs Today Show, the world listened in
  stunned silence. Scientists are now investigating the influence of his disclosure
  on levels of HIV testing. About 1.2 million people in the United States are currently
  living with HIV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that,
  of those, 1 in 8 do not know that they have the disease. Because of the stigma attached
  to HIV, any event that prompts people to get tested must be capitalized upon, officials
  say. Charlie Sheens television declaration was one such event. Read more: Latest

  such films as "Platoon" and "Young Guns" as well as the television series "Two and
  a Half Men" and "Spin City." Following his interview in November 2015, Sheen became
  one of the most prominent celebrities who is publicly HIV-positive. His interview
  preceded a huge spike in online search queries for topics regarding HIV prevention
  and testing. This surge appeared even though neither Sheen nor official health agencies
  called for action. In April 2016, researchers from San Diego State University Graduate
  School of Public Health in California published a study in JAMA Internal Medicine
  . Their investigation examined the boost in internet traffic around the subject
  of HIV tests. They documented a rise in Google searches that included terms such
  as "tests," "testing," or "test," and "HIV." Led by research professor John W. Ayers,
  the team concluded that "Sheens disclosure may benefit public health by helping
  people learn more about HIV infection and prevention." One year later, Ayers set
  out to discover whether the publics behavior matched the jump in Internet activity.
  His teams findings are published this week in the journal Prevention Science. Read

  OraQuick is the only rapid HIV test kit available for home use in the U.S. Ayers
  analysis centered on sales data for this product to see whether or not they correlated
  with the uptick in search traffic. Study co-author Eric Leas explains, "Our strategy
  allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the ''Charlie Sheen effect on HIV
  prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet
  searches." During the week of Sheens announcement, OraQuick sales almost doubled,
  hitting an all-time high. They remained significantly elevated for three weeks,
  with "8,225 more sales than expected." "In absolute terms, its hard to appreciate
  the magnitude of Sheens disclosure. However, when we compared Sheens disclosure
  to other traditional awareness campaigns the ''Charlie Sheen effect is astonishing,"
  said study co-author Benjamin Althouse of the Institute of Disease Modeling. The
  increase in OraQuick sales was a surprising seven times larger than the sales usually
  associated with World AIDS Day - the largest and longest-running HIV prevention
  awareness event. Read more: Antibody research produces new hope for HIV treatments
