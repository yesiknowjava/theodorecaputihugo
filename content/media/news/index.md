article: 'Lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) teens are at least twice as
  likely as their heterosexual peers to use illegal drugs like cocaine, ecstasy, heroin
  and methamphetamines, a U.S. study suggests. Previous research suggests that stressors
  related to being closeted or coming out and being rejected by family or friends
  could contribute to an increased risk of substance use among sexual minority teens,
  senior study author John Ayers of San Diego State University in California said.
  For the new study, researchers looked at data from roughly 14,703 high school students
  who had been surveyed about their lifetime and prior-month use of 15 different substances,
  including illegal drugs as well as tobacco, alcohol and prescription drugs that
  weren''t given to them by a physician. Overall, LGBQ teens were 12 percent more
  likely than other teens to report any substance use in their lifetimes and 27 percent
  more likely to report substance use in the previous month, the study found. LGBQ
  youth were more than three times more likely to try heroin or methamphetamines at
  least once, and more than twice as likely to try ecstasy or cocaine, the study also
  found. Stressors faced by LGBQ teens, such as stigma and isolation, "may make drugs
  foolishly appear attractive as a coping mechanism," Ayers said by email. "Even experimentation
  with these harder drugs can derail a teen''s future," he said. The vast majority
  of teens didn''t use illegal drugs, regardless of sexual orientation, researchers
  report in the American Journal of Public Health. For example, 6.6 percent of LBGQ
  teens had used heroin in their lifetimes, compared with 1.3 percent of heterosexual
  youth. And, 8.6 percent of LGBQ adolescents had used methamphetamines compared with
  2.1 percent of other teens. Marijuana was more common, used at some point by half
  of LGBQ youth and almost 38 percent of other teens. Teen drinking and smoking were
  even more common. Almost 72 percent of LGBQ teens had tried alcohol in their lifetimes,
  as had 63 percent of heterosexual youth. With cigarettes, 47 percent of LGBQ youth
  said they had smoked at least once, as did 31 percent of heterosexual teens. Just
  over 11 percent of adolescents in the study identified as a sexual minority: 2 percent
  were lesbian or gay, 6 percent were bisexual, and 3.2 percent were questioning their
  identities. The study wasn''t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether
  or sexual orientation might directly influence substance use or impact how much
  teens smoked, drank or did drugs. Smaller studies, however, have suggested that
  sexual minority youth are at greater risk for alcohol and other drug use, "and this
  large national study strengthens this understanding," said Kimberly O''Brien, a
  researcher at Boston Children''s Hospital and Education Development Center and a
  psychiatry instructor at Harvard Medical School. "The fact that the proportion of
  youth who identify as LGBQ is increasing (makes) it even more important for families
  and professionals to pay attention to this relationship because of the increasing
  numbers of youth affected," O''Brien, who wasn''t involved in the study, said by
  email. Parents can call the national Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
