summary: Lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) teens are at least twice as
  likely as their heterosexual peers to use illegal drugs like cocaine, ecstasy, heroin
  and methamphetamines, a U.S. study suggests. Overall, LGBQ teens were 12 percent
  more likely than other teens to report any substance use in their lifetimes and
  27 percent more likely to report substance use in the previous month, the study
  found. Stressors faced by LGBQ teens, such as stigma and isolation, "may make drugs
  foolishly appear attractive as a coping mechanism," Ayers said by email. Almost
  72 percent of LGBQ teens had tried alcohol in their lifetimes, as had 63 percent
  of heterosexual youth. With cigarettes, 47 percent of LGBQ youth said they had smoked
  at least once, as did 31 percent of heterosexual teens.
