summary: Overall, LGBQ teens were 12 percent more likely than other teens to report
  any substance use in their lifetimes and 27 percent more likely to report substance
  use in the previous month, the study found. Stressors faced by LGBQ teens, such
  as stigma and isolation, "may make drugs foolishly appear attractive as a coping
  mechanism," Ayers said by email. Marijuana was more common, used at some point by
  half of LGBQ youth and almost 38 percent of other teens. Almost 72 percent of LGBQ
  teens had tried alcohol in their lifetimes, as had 63 percent of heterosexual youth.
  With cigarettes, 47 percent of LGBQ youth said they had smoked at least once, as
  did 31 percent of heterosexual teens.
