  Philip MorrisTHURSDAY, Jan. 25, 2017 -- Controversial "heat-not-burn" tobacco devices
  might only get limited marketing in the United States, based on recommendations
  issued Thursday by an influential government panel. According to Caputi, "the available
  evidence does suggest that heat-not-burn tobacco products -- if they're approved
  by the FDA -- will be coming to a store near you." Because of that, "we need to
  combat unfounded claims surrounding the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco
  products," he said. "Public health professionals need to form a strategy to ensure
  that same problem doesn't happen to heat-not-burn products."
