summary: By Robert Preidt, HealthDay Reporter(HealthDay)TUESDAY, Dec. 19, 2017 (HealthDay
  News) -- Teens who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning (LGBQ) have a much
  higher risk for suicidal behavior than other teens, a new study has found. Nearly
  40 percent of LGBQ teens told researchers that they had seriously considered suicide
  in the past year. The investigators determined that LGBQ teens were 2.45 times more
  likely to consider suicide, nearly 3.6 times more likely to plan a suicide and about
  3.4 times more likely to attempt suicide than were heterosexual teens. Every possible
  measure must be taken to help LGBQ youth, study co-author Dr. Davey Smith said in
  the news release. Smith also said that researchers must do more to tackle the potential
  causes of suicide among LGBQ youth, such as stigma.
