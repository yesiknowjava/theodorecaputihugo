summary: 'tech2 News StaffFor India, the #MeToo movement has been the highlight of
  the year 2018, but in countries abroad, this campaign against sexual harassment
  kicked off sometime in October 2017. In India, the #MeToo movement began in 2018
  after Bollywood actress Tanushree Dutta accused actor Nana Patekar of sexual harassment.
  Searches related specifically to reporting sexual harassment and assault were 30
  percent higher than expected over the last eight months of the study. And searches
  related to preventive training for sexual harassment and assault were 51 percent
  higher than expected. These results suggest that #MeToo may have reduced the stigma
  of reporting or discussing sexual harassment and assault, the authors conclude.'
