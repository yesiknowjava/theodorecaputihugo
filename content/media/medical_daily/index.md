article: 'After Charlie Sheens HIV announcement the sale of at-home test kits for
  the virus nearly doubled, according to a study. Human immunodeficiency virus infection,
  or HIV, can lead to AIDS if not treated. Amidst many rumors in 2015, the actor went
  on NBCs Today Show to publicly announce he was HIV-positive. During the week of
  his announcement, the sale of at-home test kits soared, and continued to sell at
  high rates even a month later, researchers found in an updated study on the "Charlie
  Sheen Effect." Although the study cannot confirm his disclosure was the cause of
  the spike in sales, the authors observed a significant increase. Read: HIV Survival
  Is Nearly On Par With Healthy Population Thanks To Antiretroviral Drugs "In total,
  there were 8,225 more sales than expected around Sheens disclosure, surpassing World
  AIDS Day by a factor of about 7," the authors write in their paper, published in
  Prevention Science. Photo courtesy of Pixabay The same researchers previously found
  that after Sheens announcement there was an increase in internet searchers for information
  on HIV. In their new study, they wanted to observe if the searches led to an increase
  in testing. To do so, they analyzed the weekly sales of OraQuick, one of two FDA-approved
  testing kits. "Public health for more than three decades has delivered a consistent
  message about HIV: Get tested, know the signs, and use condoms," study author John
  W. Ayers, said in a statement. "That message was so well-ingrained that when the
  public was presented with Sheen''s HIV-positive disclosure, they began seeking out
  public health salient information on HIV testing, the signs of HIV, and condoms."

  was being able to successfully use Google searches to predict HIV testing sales
  within 70 percent for the given weeks. Another celebrity who went public about his
  HIV-status was professional basketball player Magic Johnson. "Yet, Sheen''s disclosure
  could be different," said study author Mark Dredze. "With Sheen, unlike with Magic
  Johnson for instance, we have smartphones in our pockets that we can easily use
  to learn about HIV within seconds with a single search or click." Drezde describes
  his disclosure as "potentially the most significant domestic HIV prevention event
  ever." Furthermore, the authors note that their findings "reinforce how celebrity
  can impact health-decision making." A similar effect was seen in 2013 when actress
  Angelina Jolie revealed she carried the BRCA gene and underwent a double mastectomy
  to lower her risk of developing breast cancer. After her announcement, there was
  a noticeable spike in genetic testing for breast cancer genes. See also: Charlie
