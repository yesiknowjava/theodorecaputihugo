summary: FDA wants stronger warning on breast implants about risks The FDA wants women
  getting breast implants to receive stronger warnings and more details about the
  risks and complications associated with the procedure. The new guidance comes after
  reports in recent months linking certain kinds of implants with illnesses in women
  with the products. In July, the FDA asked Allergan to recall a type of its textured
  breast implants after several hundred women who received the implants developed
  a rare type of lymphoma. Google searches for CBD have skyrocketed in recent years
  CBD products are widely advertised as a treatment for a plethora of ailments, and
  a new study finds that Google searches for such items have also skyrocketed recently.
  There were more than 6 million searches last April, which outnumbered searches for
  other health terms including acupuncture and meditation.
