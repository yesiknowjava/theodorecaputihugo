  WEDNESDAY, Dec. 20, 2017 -- Teens who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning,
  or LGBQ, have a much higher risk for suicidal behavior than other teens, a new study
  has found. Nearly 40 percent of LGBQ teens told researchers that they had seriously
  considered suicide in the past year. In addition, 35 percent had planned suicide
  and 25 percent had attempted suicide. Advertisement By comparison, 15 percent of
  heterosexual teens had seriously considered suicide, 12 percent had planned it and
  6 percent had attempted it, the researchers said. "There have been some indications
  that LGBQ youth face increased suicide risks, yet many believed the jury was still
  out," study co-author John Ayers said in a news release from San Diego State University.
  "Our study yields a clear verdict: LGBQ youth face staggeringly high suicide risks,"
  Ayers said. He is an associate research professor with the university''s School
  of Public Health. Data used in the study came from a federal government health survey
  of over 15,600 U.S. high school students. The investigators determined that LGBQ
  teens were 2.45 times more likely to consider suicide, nearly 3.6 times more likely
  to plan a suicide and about 3.4 times more likely to attempt suicide than were heterosexual
  teens. To compare LGBQ and heterosexual teens, the researchers adjusted the data
  to account for differences in age, gender, race, academic grades and English proficiency.
  Further analysis revealed that the risk for suicidal behavior was especially high
  among bisexual boys. Among them, 39 percent had seriously considered suicide, compared
  with 10 percent of heterosexual boys. The study was published Dec. 19 in the Journal
  of the American Medical Association. Every possible measure must be taken to help
  LGBQ youth, study co-author Dr. Davey Smith said in the news release. He''s a clinician
  researcher at the university''s School of Medicine and an advocate for sexual minority
  patients. "Parents, teachers, caretakers, and advocates need to be vigilant," he
  said. "If youth show signs of suicidal risk, they should seek supportive help from
  professionals." Smith also said that researchers must do more to tackle the potential
  causes of suicide among LGBQ youth, such as stigma. RELATED Young Americans lead
