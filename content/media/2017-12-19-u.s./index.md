article: '(Reuters Health) - - Lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) teens
  are more than three times as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers,
  a U.S. study suggests. LGBT flags are displayed at Chueca quarter during World Pride
  in Madrid, Spain, June 30, 2017. REUTERS/Susana Vera In a national survey of almost
  16,000 youth, about 25 percent of LBGQ teens said they had attempted suicide at
  least once in the previous year, compared with roughly 6 percent of heterosexual
  teens, researchers report in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Sexual
  minority youth were also more than twice as likely to contemplate suicide or plan
  a suicide attempt even if they didnt go through with it, the study also found. "LGBQ
  teens face staggeringly high suicide risks," said senior study author John Ayers,
  a researcher at San Diego State University. "We must recognize LGBQ teen suicide
  is a national public health crisis and bring extraordinary resources to bear to
  address the crisis," Ayers said by email. While some previous research has pointed
  to the increased suicide risks for sexual minority teens, the current study offers
  fresh evidence from a large, nationally representative survey of U.S. high school
  students. Overall, 89 percent of the participants identified themselves as heterosexual
  in the 2015 survey. Another 2 percent identified as gay or lesbian, while 6 percent
  said they were bisexual and 3.2 percent said they were questioning or unsure about
  their sexual identity. To assess suicide risk, participants were asked how many
  times in the past year they had seriously considered suicide, planned a suicide
  attempt or tried to kill themselves. Among sexual minorities, 40 percent of the
  teens said they had considered suicide and 35 percent of them planned a suicide
  attempt, the study found. By contrast, 15 percent of heterosexual adolescents said
  they had considered suicide and 12 percent said they had planned a suicide attempt.
  The increased suicide risk for sexual minority teens held true when researchers
  looked at females and males separately. Lesbians were more than twice as likely
  to attempt suicide as heterosexual young women, and the odds were more than tripled
  for bisexuals. Gay teens were more than four times as likely to attempt suicide
  as heterosexual males, while bisexuals had more than five times the risk. The study
  wasnt a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how sexual orientation
  might influence suicide risk. Researchers also lacked data on gender identity or
  transgender youth, who may have an even higher risk of suicide than gay and bisexual
  teens. Even so, the results add to the evidence suggesting that sexual minority
  teens have a higher risk of suicide than other youth, said Hongying Dai, a researcher
  at Childrens Mercy Hospital and the University of Missouri-Kansas City who wasnt
  involved in the study. While the study didnt address what might have driven teens
  to consider or attempt suicide, its possible sexual minority teens might have been
  at increased risk because they experienced verbal harassment, physical bullying
  or felt unsafe at school, Dai said by email. "Studies have linked high levels of
  stress due to social stigma, marginalization, discrimination and experiences of
  bullying with a wide range of risky health behaviors, including suicidal behaviors,"
  Dai said. Parents may help reduce this stress by talking to their kids, said Kimberly
  McManama, a psychiatry researcher at Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical
  School who wasnt involved in the study. "Talk to your kids about their sexual and
  gender identity early and often," McManama said by email. "Let them know that whatever
  they are feeling is ok with you and that you are ready and willing to talk about
  it with them when they are." SOURCE: bit.ly/2CGxsDv JAMA, online December 19, 2017.'
