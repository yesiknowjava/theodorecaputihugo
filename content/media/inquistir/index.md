summary: A new study, led by San Diego State University Graduate School of Public
  Health associate research professor John W. Ayers, demonstrates how easy it is for
  Americans to purchase marijuana online. "By studying anonymized, aggregate internet
  searches and search results, we were able to directly observe the online marijuana
  marketplace." The overall annual growth-rate for marijuana shopping searches, researchers
  found, was significantly positive since 2005, in all studied states, bar Alabama
  and Mississippi. However, for some searches, all links on the first page of Google
  were pointing to online marijuana retailers. Conclusions"Millions of Americans search
  for marijuana online, and websites where marijuana can be purchased are often the
  top search result," researchers concluded, adding that "marijuana can be sold in
  states that do not currently allow it."
