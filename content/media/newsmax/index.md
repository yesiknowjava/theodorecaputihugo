summary: Sexual minority youth were also more than twice as likely to contemplate
  suicide or plan a suicide attempt even if they didnt go through with it, the study
  also found. To assess suicide risk, participants were asked how many times in the
  past year they had seriously considered suicide, planned a suicide attempt or tried
  to kill themselves. By contrast, 15 percent of heterosexual adolescents said they
  had considered suicide and 12 percent said they had planned a suicide attempt. The
  increased suicide risk for sexual minority teens held true when researchers looked
  at females and males separately. The study wasnt a controlled experiment designed
  to prove whether or how sexual orientation might influence suicide risk.
