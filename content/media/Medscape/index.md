article: 'That smart device sitting in your kitchen can play music, pull up recipes,
  and even flatulate on command. However, a team of California researchers says these
  virtual assistants have the the potential to help individuals fight addiction --
  but they''re not there yet. Investigators examined some of today''s most popular
  intelligent virtual assistants and overwhelmingly found the devices failed to provide
  useful information in response to queries for addiction help. In fact, only 4 of
  70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses,
  only one of which was even slightly helpful. "Most of the time, the responses reflected
  the device''s confusion," study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center
  for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego
  in La Jolla. "Nevertheless, I don''t want to look at these results and say this
  is a tragedy," Ayers told Medscape Medical News. "What we''re trying to do is shine
  the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes
  to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants. So we want to point out to
  them that there''s a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote
  them?" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing
  the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon''s Alexa,
  Apple''s Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft''s Cortana, and Samsung''s Bixby -- are
  transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search
  engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting
  users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual
  assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. "There''s
  a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer," Ayers said. "So there''s
  all this potential for these devices to be used for help." The appeal of virtual
  assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults
  already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment.
  Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent
  investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related
  queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
  Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries,
  intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the
  potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem
  poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies.
  "Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they''re moving into the
  healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where
  Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,"
  said Ayers. "So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine
  their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study," he added. The
  researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent
  99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device''s operating software was up
  to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US
  English. Each query was prefaced by ''Help me quit...'' followed by either a generic
  or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids.
  Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70
  queries. "We asked these questions because there''s already an established norm
  regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800
  hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment
  or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,"
  said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend
  medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English
  speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants'' responses were recorded verbatim.
  Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual
  assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was
  the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service?
  Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking
  queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The
  most common response was one of confusion, such as "Did I say something wrong?"
  Specifically, when the five devices were asked "Help me quit drugs," only Amazon
  Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term "drugs." No other
  virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the
  results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol
  and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related
  queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device.
  When Apple''s Siri was asked to "Help me quit pot," the device directed users to
  a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular
  results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to "Help me quit smoking" or "Help
  me quit tobacco," the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation
  app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants
  currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This,
  they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an
  increasingly meaningful role in people''s lives. For example, when asked to help
  with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone
  counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated
  for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing
  individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP)
  for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent
  virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. "If you look at political
  debate today, there''s a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back.
  So here''s a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful
  way for problems that are easily solvable," he said. Potential for Good Commenting
  on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not
  involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. "Even if developers
  programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee
  people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner," said Bickmore, from
  the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.
  "There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational
  assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their
  capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. "Two,
  there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural
  language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,"
  Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. "At the end of the day,
  I think there''s capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend
  time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit.
  "Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching
  Alexa to fart and let''s help people who are desperately seeking help for their
  substance use problems," Ayers said. This study was supported by the Tobacco-Related
  Disease Research Program. Ayers and Bickmore have disclosed no relevant financial
  relationships. npj Digital Medicine. Published online January 29, 2020. Full text
