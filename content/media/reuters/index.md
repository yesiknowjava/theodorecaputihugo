summary: 'For the study, researchers monitored the volume of Google searches originating
  in the U.S. from January 1, 2010 through June 15, 2018 related to sexual harassment
  and assault. During the last eight months of the study period - after #MeToo began
  - there were 40 to 54 million Google searches related to sexual harassment or assault,
  the greatest number of searches on this topic ever recorded in the U.S., the study
  found. Searches related specifically to reporting sexual harassment and assault
  were 30 percent higher than expected over the last eight months of the study. And
  searches related to preventive training for sexual harassment and assault were 51
  percent higher than expected. These results suggest that #MeToo may have reduced
  the stigma of reporting or discussing sexual harassment and assault, the authors
  conclude.'
