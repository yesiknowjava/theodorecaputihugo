summary: Turns out, lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning (LGBQ) teens are at substantially
  higher risk of substance use than their heterosexual peers. According to a new study
  led by San Diego State University researchers, LGBQ teens are more likely to use
  dangerous drugs. LGBQ teens were also at greater risk for having used harder drugs.
  Compared to their heterosexual peers, LGBQ teens faced an elevated risk for going
  use of alcohol, cigarettes, cigars, vaping, and marijuana. The team noted these
  new data should not be used to judge LGBQ teens.
