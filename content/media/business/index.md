article: Turns out, lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning (LGBQ) teens are at substantially
  higher risk of substance use than their heterosexual peers. According to a new study
  led by San Diego State University researchers, LGBQ teens are more likely to use
  dangerous drugs. As part of the most recent National Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
  15,624 high school students were asked about their use of 15 substances, including
  alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. The survey also included questions about sexual identity,
  including whether teens identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning. The
  data showed LGBQ teens were more likely to have ever used 14 of the 15 substances
  studied, including alcohol, cigarettes, cigars, cocaine, ecstasy, electronic vapor
  ("vaping"), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, marijuana, methamphetamine, prescription
  drugs (without physician direction), steroids, and synthetic marijuana. LGBQ teens
  were also at greater risk for having used harder drugs. The survey included questions
  gauging potential ongoing use for some substances by asking about their use during
  the past 30 days. Compared to their heterosexual peers, LGBQ teens faced an elevated
  risk for going use of alcohol, cigarettes, cigars, vaping, and marijuana. Study
  coauthor John W. Ayers said, "There have been some indications that LGBQ teens face
  increased substance use risks, but our study shows for the first time that the problem
  goes far beyond alcohol and tobacco, including the hardest most dangerous drugs."
  The team noted these new data should not be used to judge LGBQ teens. An LGBTQ researcher
  at the University of California, coauthor Laramie Smith said, " Our findings highlight
  the need for accepting LGBQ teens, as stigma may be playing a role in elevating
  their substance use risk or prevent those from needing help to speak up." The team
  also encouraged parents, teachers, caretakers, and advocates to be vigilant. The
  full findings are published in the journal- American Journal of Public (This story
