  Dec. 20, 2017 -- Teens who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning, or LGBQ, have
  a much higher risk for suicidal behavior than other teens, a new study has found.
  Nearly 40 percent of LGBQ teens told researchers that they had seriously considered
  suicide in the past year. The investigators determined that LGBQ teens were 2.45
  times more likely to consider suicide, nearly 3.6 times more likely to plan a suicide
  and about 3.4 times more likely to attempt suicide than were heterosexual teens.
  Every possible measure must be taken to help LGBQ youth, study co-author Dr. Davey
  Smith said in the news release.
