summary: John W. Ayers Jr., Theodore Caputi, and Eric C. Leas said that misleading
  advertising can be found throughout the for-profit marijuana industry. But the three
  physicians were especially critical of MedMen Enterprises,a Culver City-based company
  that operates in many states, and in many cities, including San Diego. "Health and
  medicine are implied in the name of this company, even though a majority of MedMens
  stores sell recreational marijuana," the physicians state in the viewpoint article.
  Many doctors, including some at UC San Diego Health, prescribe cannabis to help
  some patients cope with chronic pain. And UCSD is currently doing a small clinical
  trial to see if CBD can alleviate severe autism in children.
