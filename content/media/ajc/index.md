summary: 'After analyzing the results, they found that lesbian, gay, bisexual and
  questioning teens were more than four times as likely to attempt suicide. Furthermore,
  40 percent of LGBQ youth said they seriously considered suicide and 35 percent of
  LGBQ kids had actually planned a suicide, compared to 15 and 12 percent of heterosexual
  teens, respectively. Researchers lacked data on gender identity or transgender youth,
  who may have an even higher risk of suicide than gay and bisexual teens. "Our work
  has identified a serious problem, but fortunately decades of science and experience
  can be leveraged to address LGBQ youth''s suicide risk," Ayers said. >>RELATED:
