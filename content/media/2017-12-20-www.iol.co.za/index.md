article: Durban - Gay teenagers were almost five times as likely to show a higher
  prevalence for suicide-risk behaviour than their heterosexual peers, a research
  has showed. The findings showed that one in four or 40 per cent of gay, lesbian,
  bisexual or questioning (LGBQ) adolescents seriously considered, planned or attempted
  suicide compared to 15 per cent of their heterosexual counterparts. Nearly a quarter
  of LGBQ adolescents attempted suicide compared to approximately six per cent of
  those in the sexual majority. "The most staggering finding, the one that really
  makes you think, is just how prevalent these suicide-risk behaviours are in the
  LGBQ adolescent community," said Theodore L. Caputi, from the University College
  Cork in Ireland. "Research has shown that suicide-risk behaviours are an indicator
  of extreme distress," added Caputi, who was formerly in the University of Pennsylvania.
  Further, variations in risk between those who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or queer
  were also observed. While female students were overall at the highest risks of suicidal
  thoughts or attempts, but the gap between risks for gay males and straight males
  was the widest. Nearly one-third of bisexual adolescents reported attempting suicide
  in the past 12 months, and 46 per cent had considered it. "There are clearly differences
  in how sexual-minority adolescents experience the world," Caputi said. "External
  stressors like stigma and isolation are significant contributing factors, and those
  weigh on members of these high-risk communities." For the study, published in the
  Journal of the American Medical Association, the team surveyed 15,624 high-school
  age participants.
