  The heat-not-burn device or HNB has become a new alternative to e-cigarettes and
  experts are saying that this trend is only set to increase. HNB devices work by
  gently heating the tobacco to 260 degrees Celsius temperature which in turn, creates
  a tobacco like vapour which is the result of heating tobacco rather than burning
  it, where temperatures reach around 600-800 degrees Celsius. According to Dr John
  Ayers, an associate research professor at the San Diego State University, they are
  becoming more popular because they appeal to smokers who are quitting but still
  demand the ''throat-hit'' sensation which is delivered by a regular cigarette but
  not by most e-cigarettes. A study by Ayers and his team discovered that although
  HNB devices are currently only available to buy in a handful of places around the
  world, their findings showed a huge surge in demand for the heat-not-burn devices
  - rising by 2,956% in two years from 2015 to 2017. The studys co-author, Professor
  Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said: "This [study] suggests
  that as heat-not-burn tobacco is introduced in new markets, its popularity may even
  eclipse e-cigarettes." Here''s a look at the product. Advertisement However, HNB
  devices have been proven to contain nicotine which is an addictive substance and
  the HNB devices are not completely risk-free, much like the e-cigarette. Furthermore,
  Dr Reto Auer, of the University of Bern, has stated that there''s isn''t enough
  information about smoking heat-not-burn cigarettes. He believes that their use should
  be restricted in the meantime. In his study on HNB devices, harmful chemicals were
  present and he said that more studies were needed to find out if they were safe
  for use. "We need more studies to find out about the health consequences. Some of
  these chemicals may contribute to the high mortality rate of smokers," he said.
