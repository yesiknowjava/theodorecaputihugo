article: 'tech2 News Staff For India, the #MeToo movement has been the highlight of
  the year 2018, but in countries abroad, this campaign against sexual harassment
  kicked off sometime in October 2017. And highlighting the intensity of the crusade,
  a US study suggests that millions of Americans have searched Google for information
  on how to understand, prevent and report sexual harassment and assault since the
  start of the #MeToo movement more than a year ago. In October 2017, following public
  accusations of sexual harassment and assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein,
  actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims to bring the taboo topic out of the shadows
  by sharing their own stories on social media. The resulting #MeToo movement resulted
  in widespread sharing on social media, and the new study, published in JAMA Internal
  Medicine, offers fresh evidence that the movement has contributed to a shift in
  public thinking about these issues, said senior author John Ayers of the University
  of California, San Diego. "#MeToo is not the first movement to empower victims of
  sexual violence, but what is unique compared to past movements is #MeToos staying
  power," Ayers said by email. In India, the #MeToo movement began in 2018 after Bollywood
  actress Tanushree Dutta accused actor Nana Patekar of sexual harassment. For the
  study, researchers monitored the volume of Google searches originating in the US
  from 1 January, 2010 through June 15, 2018 related to sexual harassment and assault.
  During the last eight months of the study period - after #MeToo began - there were
  40 to 54 million Google searches related to sexual harassment or assault, the greatest
  number of searches on this topic ever recorded in the US, the study found. Overall
  volume for this topic was 86 percent higher during these eight months than what
  researchers calculated would have occurred in the absence of #MeToo based on their
  analysis of the earlier years of the study. Searches related specifically to reporting
  sexual harassment and assault were 30 percent higher than expected over the last
  eight months of the study. And searches related to preventive training for sexual
  harassment and assault were 51 percent higher than expected. These results suggest
  that #MeToo may have reduced the stigma of reporting or discussing sexual harassment
  and assault, the authors conclude. Google searches may also help connect victims
  with needed support and health resources, Ayers said. "Survivors face serious health
  consequences including physical injury, PTSD symptoms, and emotional trauma," Ayers
  said. "Yet, public investments in preventing and responding to sexual violence is
  disproportionately small compared with other health issues." However, the authors
  note, online activity is only a proxy for public engagement with topics like sexual
  harassment and assault, and more research is needed to determine whether or how
  the surge in Google activity might relate to meaningful shifts in public opinion
  or behavior. Its also unclear whether surges in search activity related to sexual
  harassment and assault were sustained only by the #MeToo movement on social media
  or related also to media coverage of accusations against high-profile men across
  a wide range of industries, said Luis Rocha, a researcher at the School of Informatics
  & Computing at Indiana University in Bloomington. "This is all new territory and
  only time will tell with future studies," Rocha, who wasnt involved in the study,
  said by email. "I would think that what people do online will lead to greater awareness
  that can in turn lead to changes in workplace environments," Rocha added. "If people
  are searching online in great volumes for the topic, it means they are interested
  (even if pinged by the media) in the topic, so I would expect this to have very
  real impact in all aspects of their lives." With inputs from Reuters. 2018 has been
  an eventful year and here''s our comprehensive list of year ender stories.'
