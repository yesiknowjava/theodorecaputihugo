summary: Gay and bisexual youth have a "tragically high" risk of suicidal behaviour,
  a new study has claimed. Using data from the 2015 National Youth Risk Behaviour
  Survey, it was found that 40% of LGBQ youth had seriously considered suicide, 35%
  had planned suicide, and 25% had attempted suicide. In comparison to heterosexual
  teens, 15% had considered suicide, 12% had planned suicide, and 6% had attempted
  suicide. "LGBQ teens face staggeringly high suicide risks," senior study author
  John Ayers, a researcher at San Diego State University, told Reuters. Teens who
  identified as bisexual were at most risk, according to the study, with 46% saying
  they had considered suicide in the past year.
