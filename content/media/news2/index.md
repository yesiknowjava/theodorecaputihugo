  online every month. CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Researchers have announced the latest trend
  in online shopping: weed. The study published in the American Journal of Preventive
  Medicine Thursday found millions of Americans are searching for and illegally purchasing
  marijuana online every month - an incredibly unregulated, shockingly accessible,
  black market that can fit in the palm of your hand. "Theyre trying to provide marijuana
  at scale to the entire United States and in an illegal way," said epidemiologist
  Dr. John Ayers who led the study. Dr. Ayers and his team analyzed 12 years of online
  searches for mail order marijuana. They found up to two million people every single
  month are looking to buy weed online, including in the Carolinas. Even in states
  where marijuana is legal, buying and selling it online is not. "This isnt something
  where we need another billion dollars of research," Dr. Ayers said. "We identified
  problem, and theres a simple solution, lets just fix it." He said many of the consumers
  are kids. The online pot shops dont ask for your age, or any sort of verification
  at all. But dont get any ideas. Police are onto this, too. Three people were arrested
  this week in York County when they tried to have seven pounds of weed delivered
  to them. Dr. Ayers and his team said this blatant black market is an epidemic, and
  theyre calling for a change -fast. "Google, Bing and others can fix the problem
  for us by simply purging these providers from the search results," he said.'
