summary: 'Time similarly concluded that "There''s ''Scarce Evidence'' That Cannabis
  Helps Mental Health Issues." This review reveals something many clinicians already
  knew: We dont have enough evidence to say that cannabis can treat mental health
  disorders. AdvertisementPeople are widely using cannabis--both THC and CBD--for
  their mental health. Even results from single studies might not be enough, especially
  when it comes to difficult areas like mental health. The reason why this all matters
  is because with mental health disorders, taking something thats not helping could
  eventually end up doing harm.'
