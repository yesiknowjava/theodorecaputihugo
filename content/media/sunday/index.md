summary: A team of American doctors has highlighted the key role that virtual assistants
  could play in helping to prevent addiction. Smartphone virtual assistants like Alexa,
  Siri and Bixby are handy when you want to consult tomorrow's weather forecast, find
  the nearest open pharmacy or access a list of movie times. In response to 70 help-seeking
  queries, the intelligent virtual assistants returned only four useful replies. The
  rest of the time, the virtual assistants did not seem to understand the questions
  they were asked. "Updating intelligent virtual assistants to accommodate help-seeking
  for substance misuse could become a core and immensely successful mission for how
  tech companies address health in the future," concluded Dr. Nobles.
