  Photo by Atomazul/Shutterstock April 19 (UPI) -- People who use medical marijuana
  have higher rates of medical and non-medical prescription drug use -- including
  pain relievers -- than others, according to a new study. Researchers at Stanford
  University and University College Cork in Ireland analyzed more than 57,000 responses
  to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to determine if medical marijuana
  users also turn to opioids. Their findings were published this week in the American
  Society of Addiction Medicine's Journal of Addiction Medicine. Advertisement In
  the survey, participants were asked about medical and non-medical use of prescription
  drugs. About 1.4 percent of all respondents, 776 people, said they used medical
  marijuana. Survey participants who use medical marijuana were 60 percent more likely
  to report prescription drug use, for medical reasons or not, than those who did
  not use medical marijuana, researchers report. RELATED FDA staff backs epilepsy

  as likely to report non-medical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers,
  stimulants and tranquilizers. "Non-medical use of pain relievers is of particular
  interest because of pain relievers' role in the opioid overdose epidemic," the researchers
  wrote. Previous studies have shown that states where medical marijuana is legal
  have lower rates of medical and non-medical prescription drug use and related harms
  -- including opioid overdose. Thirty states and the District of Columbia have laws
  legalizing some form of marijuana use, including eight states that have legalized
  it for recreational use. "These reports have led many to believe that use of medical
  marijuana is a protective factor against non-medical prescription drug use," Theodore
  L. Caputi, a researcher at University College, said in a press release. "However,
  individual-level inferences cannot be made using the ecological studies cited frequently
  in the debate over medical marijuana." Caputi said previous data has shown the relationship
  between medical marijuana use and use of non-medical prescription drugs, and should
  be used as a marker for high risk patients -- but adds that additional research
  is needed on whether cannabis is being used together with or in place of prescription
  drugs. Dr. Marcus A. Bachhuber and colleagues at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert
  Einstein College of Medicine in New York wrote in an accompanying article in the
  journal that the study doesn't show that medical cannabis causes increased use of
  prescription drugs. "Given that people who take medical cannabis and those who do
  not are likely to have different underlying morbidity, it is possible that medical
  cannabis use reduces prescription drug use yet prescription drug use remains relatively
  high in that group," they wrote in the article. They noted that chronic pain is
  the most common reason for medical marijuana use, and people in other studies who
  use medical marijuana consistently report substituting cannabis for other drugs.
  In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine issued a report
  concluding that pot can significantly reduce pain symptoms. "To fully understand
  the effect of medical cannabis on the use of other drugs, prospective longitudinal
  studies randomizing patients to cannabis versus other treatments are urgently needed,"
  they wrote.
