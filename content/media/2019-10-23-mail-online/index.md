article: According to our Google searches, Americans are more interested in CBD than
  any other health product or topic, a new study reveals. In the US, an average of
  6.4 million unique Google searches are made for CBD each month - more than those
  for meditation, exercise, veganism and even marijuana, according to the new University
  of California, San Diego research. Trendy CBD - short for cannabidiol - oils, edibles
  and other products has taken the US by storm as the marijuana derivative as legalization
  has spread to 33 states for medical purposes and 11 for recreational use. It's sold
  in dispensaries, pharmacies and entire cafes have cropped up to peddle CBD, advertising
  it for everything from anxiety to acne and menstrual cramps But in reality, its
  only proven and FDA-approved use is to seizures, argue the study authors who compare
  the product to 'snake oil.' There are some 6.4 million unique Google searches a
  month for CBD oil, according to new research - but the study authors warn all but
  one of the trendy product's uses are 'unproven' 'CBD has become insanely popular,'
  said study co-author Dr John Ayers, the Vice Chief of Innovation in the Division
  of Infectious Disease and Global Public Health at UC San Diego. 'Three years ago,
  there was essentially no one searching about CBD online, but now there are an estimated
  6.4 million unique searches each month.' It's not just online that the product is
  having a 'moment.' On the first of this month, the first cannabis cafe in the US
  opened shop in Los Angeles and is now serving up joints as a side dish to farm-to-table
  dinners and boasting its own dispensary area for marijuana products. And despite
  warnings from local health officials, coffee shops in many states have been offering
  to drop some CBD into lattes - for a small additional fee - to help customers calm
  down while they get caffeinated up for their days. But those promised advantages
  haven't been confirmed. Studies have suggested all kinds of potential benefits of
  CBD, the non psychoactive ingredient in marijuana - but those findings have not
  been verified. Depending on the state, patients can get a medical marijuana 'prescription'
  for conditions like wasting disease, nausea, easing chemotherapy side effects, HIV/AIDS,
  chronic pain, seizures, PTSD, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and more. It's legally allowed,
  but scientifically unfounded, according to the UC San Diego researchers. And in
  many states, the non-psychoactive CBD can easily be obtained without a prescription
  of any sort, like Advil or DayQuil coudl be. 'At this time there are no known benefits
  for taking CBD over-the-counter,' said Dr Davey Smith, a physician and Chief of
  Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at UC San Diego. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
  THC AND CBD Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are both derived from
  the cannabis plant. Together, they are part of the cannabinoid group of compounds
  found in hashish, hash oil, and most strains of marijuana. THC is the psychoactive
  compound responsible for the euphoric, 'high' feeling often associated with marijuana.
  THC interacts with CB1 receptors in the central nervous system and brain and creates
  the sensations of euphoria and anxiety. CBD does not fit these receptors well, and
  actually decreases the effects of THC, and is not psychoactive. CBD is thought to
  help reduce anxiety and inflammation. Advertisement 'CBD is this generation's snake
  oil, where millions are engaging with the product without evidence of any benefit.'
  Scientists' skepticism has done little to stop Americans from flocking to the trendy
  product, which has quickly become the hottest topic in health and wellness, according
  to the new study. 'When talking to colleagues about our study we often play a game
  we call "CBD or" and almost every time experts are shocked to learn that CBD is
  more popular or nearly as popular,' said Dr Alicia Nobles a research fellow at UC
  San Diego. 'Consider this one example. For every two internet searches for dieting
  in the United States we found there is one for CBD!' The study, published in JAMA
  Network Open,' also found that there are now nearly seven-and-a-half-times as many
  unique online searchers for CBD as for acupuncture, five-times more than for apple
  cider vinegar and over three-times as many as for meditation. CBD searches surpassed
  vaccination searchers by 63 percent, exercise by nearly 60 percent, veganism by
  12 percent, and even its own parent plant, marijuana, by 13 percent. The rise of
  CBD searchers has been steep, and the researchers predict it will only continue.
  Searches for the compound increased by 125 percent over the course of 2017 and another
  160 percent during 2018. Now, researchers project another 180 percent increase by
  the end of this year. And the growth of interest in CBD has persisted across all
  regions of the country. Though its broadly viewed as harmless, some patients have
  sought out CBD as not just a complement to but substitute for proven treatments
  of life-threatening diseases, including cancer, a pattern that has experts deeply
  concerned. 'Some consumers might forgo seeing a physician or taking medications
  with known, tested and approved therapeutic benefits in favor of CBD and thereby
  become sicker or succumb to their illness,' said Dr Smith. 'Now is the time to act,'
  added Ayers. 'Government regulators must step up to the plate give CBD products
  the same level of scrutiny as other proven medications. 'Moreover, anyone considering
  taking CBD should know there are no proven over-the-counter health benefits.'
