  researchers at UC San Diego are warning against marijuana advertisements that boast
  health benefits, saying the claims are problematic and need to be independently
  verified. Related: UC San Diego Doctor Uses Cannabis To Treat Pain In a recent column
  in the Journal of the American Medical Association, John Ayers, Ph.D. a computational
  epidemiologist at UC San Diego, calls on government agencies to regulate the branding
  practices of cannabis retailers. In the column, Ayers referenced the national marijuana
  brand, MedMen, which has locations in San Diego. Health and medicine are implied
  in the name of this company, even though a majority of MedMens stores sell recreational
  marijuana. Billboards read, "Heal. Its Legal." The companys blog Ember: A Journal
  of Cannabis and Culture has an entire section dedicated to health, including a claim
  that marijuana ''can reduce anxiety, pain, and so much more,''" Ayers wrote. "The
  only health warnings included on the MedMen website are ''marijuana products impairs
  your ability to drive and operate machinery'' and that MedMen ''can not guarantee
  the accuracy of any marijuana information provided'' on its website." "These claims
  are reckless because there''s no substantial evidence showing that marijuana has
  any therapeutic benefit," Ayers said. He joined Midday Edition Thursday to talk
  about why he thinks marketing regulation is an urgent priority. Sign up for Today''s
