article: 'If the eyes are a window to the soul, then surely Google searches are a
  window into our thoughts. And since actress Alyssa Milano drew attention to the
  #MeToo movement -- begun more than a decade earlier by the activist Tarana Burke
  -- with a tweet in October 2017, Americans have been thinking quite a lot about
  sexual harassment and sexual assault. That tweet, written after articles in the
  New York Times and the New Yorker recounted accusations of abusive behavior by Hollywood
  producer Harvey Weinstein, encouraged other victims of sexual harassment and sexual
  assault to share their stories as well. They did so in droves: The #MeToo hashtag
  was tweeted about 300,000 times on that first day alone. If youve been sexually
  harassed or assaulted write ''me too as a reply to this tweet. pic.twitter.com/k2oeCiUf9n
  -- Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 15, 2017 It now appears that Milanos exhortation
  sent Americans to Google in droves to learn more about what exactly qualified as
  sexual harassment and sexual assault -- and what they could do about it. Advertisement
  A research team from Harvard Medical School and UC San Diego documented the extent
  of this self-education campaign by examining trends in Google searches between Jan.
  1, 2004, and Oct. 14, 2017, the day before Milanos fateful tweet. Extrapolating
  from that data, they used an algorithm to estimate how many times Americans would
  have searched the terms "sexual" with "harassment" and "sexual" with "assault" between
  Oct. 15, 2017, and June 15, 2018, if the #MeToo movement had never happened. They
  also made predictions about searches involving either of those combinations along
  with the terms "report" or "reporting," or with "train" or "training." Then the
  researchers compared these counterfactual scenarios to the actual number of searches
  conducted with these keywords during the eight-month period. Sure enough, online
  interest in sexual harassment and assault spiked in the U.S., the researchers found.
  "The post-#MeToo period corresponded with the greatest number of sexual harassment
  and/or assault searches ever recorded in the United States," the researchers reported
  Friday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. They exact number of searches was
  difficult to pin down, but the team wrote that it was somewhere between 40 million
  and 54 million over the entire 8 months. That was 86% higher than they would have
  expected in the absence of #MeToo. The search volume was significantly higher than
  expected in every week throughout the 8-month span, they added. The researchers
  also documented a 30% increase in searches about reporting instances of sexual harassment
  or sexual assault, along with a 51% increase in searches about training to prevent
  harassment and assault in the first place. Both of those trends took off a short
  time after Milanos tweet, according to the study. Advertisement "Our findings demonstrate
  the power of grass-roots movements to respond to large-scale public health crises,"
  the team concluded. "Public health leaders should respond by investing in enhanced
  prevention training and improving resources for survivors." karen.kaplan@latimes.com
