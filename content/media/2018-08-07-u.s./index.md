article: '(Reuters Health) - Lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning teens are at least
  twice as likely as their heterosexual peers to use illegal drugs like cocaine, ecstasy,
  heroin and methamphetamines, a U.S. study suggests. Previous research suggests that
  stressors related to being closeted or coming out and being rejected by family or
  friends could contribute to an increased risk of substance use among sexual minority
  teens, senior study author John Ayers of San Diego State University in California
  told Reuters Health. For the new study, researchers looked at data from roughly
  14,703 high school students who had been surveyed about their lifetime and prior-month
  use of 15 different substances, including illegal drugs as well as tobacco, alcohol
  and prescription drugs that werent given to them by a physician. Overall, LGBQ teens
  were 12 percent more likely than other teens to report any substance use in their
  lifetimes and 27 percent more likely to report substance use in the previous month,
  the study found. LGBQ youth were more than three times more likely to try heroin
  or methamphetamines at least once, and more than twice as likely to try ecstasy
  or cocaine, the study also found. Stressors faced by LGBQ teens, such as stigma
  and isolation, "may make drugs foolishly appear attractive as a coping mechanism,"
  Ayers said by email. "Even experimentation with these harder drugs can derail a
  teens future," he said. The vast majority of teens didnt use illegal drugs, regardless
  of sexual orientation, researchers report in the American Journal of Public Health.
  For example, 6.6 percent of LBGQ teens had used heroin in their lifetimes, compared
  with 1.3 percent of heterosexual youth. And, 8.6 percent of LGBQ adolescents had
  used methamphetamines compared with 2.1 percent of other teens. Marijuana was more
  common, used at some point by half of LGBQ youth and almost 38 percent of other
  teens. Teen drinking and smoking were even more common. Almost 72 percent of LGBQ
  teens had tried alcohol in their lifetimes, as had 63 percent of heterosexual youth.
  With cigarettes, 47 percent of LGBQ youth said they had smoked at least once, as
  did 31 percent of heterosexual teens. Just over 11 percent of adolescents in the
  study identified as a sexual minority: 2 percent were lesbian or gay, 6 percent
  were bisexual, and 3.2 percent were questioning their identities. The study wasnt
  a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or sexual orientation might directly
  influence substance use or impact how much teens smoked, drank or did drugs. Smaller
  studies, however, have suggested that sexual minority youth are at greater risk
  for alcohol and other drug use, "and this large national study strengthens this
  understanding," said Kimberly OBrien, a researcher at Boston Childrens Hospital
  and Education Development Center and a psychiatry instructor at Harvard Medical
  School. "The fact that the proportion of youth who identify as LGBQ is increasing
  (makes) it even more important for families and professionals to pay attention to
  this relationship because of the increasing numbers of youth affected," OBrien,
  who wasnt involved in the study, said by email. Parents can call the national Substance
  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations hotline at 1-800-662-HELP to receive
  treatment referral from qualified experts. SOURCE: bit.ly/2LZTfiA American Journal
