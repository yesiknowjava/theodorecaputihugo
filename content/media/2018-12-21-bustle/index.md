article: 'Ever since sexual assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey
  Weinstein came to light last year, the #MeToo movement -- initially launched over
  a decade ago by activist Tarana Burke -- has prompted millions of survivors around
  the world to come forward and share their own stories. Moreover, after actress Alyssa
  Milano''s #MeToo tweet went viral in October 2017, #MeToo has caused Google searches
  about sexual assault to shatter records and reach an all-time high. Last October,
  The New York Times broke the news that Weinstein had faced numerous sexual assault
  allegations over the years, and that he had paid off his accusers. Since then, numerous
  prominent figures -- from actors and comedians to lawmakers and scientists -- have
  been held accountable for sexual violence and abuse, and the #MeToo movement has
  sparked increased awareness about these issues. Following the Weinstein scandal,
  researchers from Harvard Medical School and UC San Diego took a look at Google search
  rates for sexual harassment and sexual assault before and after Milano''s #MeToo
  tweet. To start, the researchers examined trends in these searches from Jan. 1,
  2004 to Oct. 14, 2017 -- the day before Milano first tweeted about #MeToo. They
  then used this data to roughly estimate how many times Americans would search for
  these subjects following her tweet, and found that searches for sexual harassment
  and assault were 86 percent higher than expected from Oct. 15, 2017 to June 15,
  2018. Researchers also discovered a 51 percent increase in searches about preventive
  training for sexual harassment and assault, and a 30 percent increase in searches
  about reporting cases of sexual violence. According to the Chicago Tribune, Burke
  first coined the phrase "Me Too" in 2006, in order to support women -- especially
  black women and women of color -- who had survived sexual violence. Burke has continuously
  worked to combat sexual violence, so when she saw the #MeToo hashtag go viral in
  2017, she was concerned that its extreme publicity could harm survivors. She told
  The Guardian that she was worried that the people tweeting about #MeToo wouldn''t
  go beyond the hashtag, to chart a substantial course of action. During a TED Talk
  last month, Burke reminded viewers that the #MeToo movement is meant to serve marginalized
  communities that are disproportionately impacted by sexual violence. However, she
  maintained that she still believes in the possibility of "a world free of sexual
  violence" -- and the Harvard and UCSD researchers'' work illustrates that many other
  people may share her desire to go beyond the hashtag. "The post-#MeToo period corresponded
  with the greatest number of sexual harassment and/or assault searches ever recorded
  in the United States," the researchers wrote in their report, which was published
  on Friday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Specifically, in the eight months
  after Milano''s #MeToo tweet, researchers found that there had been 40 to 54 million
  Google searches about understanding, preventing, and reporting sexual harassment
  and assault. "Our findings demonstrate the power of grass-roots movements to respond
  to large-scale public health crises," the researchers concluded. "Public health
  leaders should respond by investing in enhanced prevention training and improving
  resources for survivors." The research team also urged people to get more involved
  in combating sexual violence, noting that online search activity is not necessarily
  an indicator of how engaged people actually are.'
