summary: '"The lucrative operation at times involved moving thousands of pounds of
  marijuana and narcotics each week from narco-traffickers into the United States
  to destinations across the country, using standard cardboard boxes that were carefully
  routed through the private mail carriers trucking and delivery systems, authorities
  said," our Post colleague Arelis R. Hernandez reports. "Four UPS employees have
  been charged with drug trafficking in state court, and court records show that at
  least 11 people -- including two UPS supervisors and drivers -- have been arrested
  in the past two weeks on a slew of state charges stemming from the decade-long investigation
  by a task force of local, state and federal law enforcement."'
