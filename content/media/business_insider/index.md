summary: '"In total, there were 8,225 more sales than expected around Sheen''s disclosure,
  surpassing World AIDS Day by a factor of about 7," the researchers write in their
  paper. AdvertisementIn November 2015, Sheen appeared on NBC''s "Today" show to disclose
  his positive status. Today, one in eight of the 1.2 million Americans living with
  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not know they are positive. For their study,
  the researchers analyzed two years of sales data for HIV test kit OraQuick, the
  only fast-acting at-home kit available in the US. AdvertisementWhat they found was
  astounding: Not only had sales increased 95% the week of Sheen''s disclosure, they
  also stayed relatively high for the four following weeks.It''s well-known that celebrities
  influence our behavior.'
