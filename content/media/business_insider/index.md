article: 'Advertisement They''re calling it the "Sheen Effect."The week actor Charlie
  Sheen went on NBC''s "Today" show Tuesday to confirm rumors that he was HIV-positive
  , sales of at-home test kits for the virus rose 95%.That''s according to a new study
  from researchers at the University of Southern California and San Diego State University,
  which also found that the kits continued to sell at higher rates than expected for
  a month after the announcement.While they can''t say for sure that Sheen''s disclosure
  caused the rise in sales of the test kits, the bump they observed was record-setting.
  "In total, there were 8,225 more sales than expected around Sheen''s disclosure,
  surpassing World AIDS Day by a factor of about 7," the researchers write in their
  paper. Advertisement In November 2015, Sheen appeared on NBC''s "Today" show to
  disclose his positive status. "I''m here to admit that I am HIV-positive," he said.
  Advertisement Sheen''s physician, UCLA assistant professor of clinical medicine
  Robert Huizenga, also appeared on the show at the time, generating some confusion
  when he said that Sheen''s HIV was "undetectable" in his blood - a proclamation
  that led some to believe the actor had been "cured." In reality, Sheen''s HIV had
  simply been reduced to an undetectable level thanks to treatment with a powerful
  three-drug cocktail known as antiretroviral therapy (ART).As far as current reports
  are concerned, Sheen does not have AIDS, a condition that can develop when the HIV
  virus has dramatically suppressed the immune system to the point where someone is
  highly susceptible to infections and rare types of cancer. Sheen maintained at the
  time that he told all of his partners of his HIV status, adding that many threatened
  to blackmail him for a sum totaling "into the millions." The actor said in 2015
  he learned he had HIV in 2011 after suffering from extreme migraines and "sweating
  the bed." Thinking he might have a brain tumor, he was hospitalized. But after numerous
  tests, doctors confirmed he had HIV. One of the reasons HIV can go long periods
  before being diagnosed is that its earliest symptoms can mirror those of the flu
  - many people experience a fever, muscle aches, sore throat, and swollen glands.
  Advertisement The only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested
  While there are plenty of places to get tested for free, fear, stigma, and other
  socioeconomic barriers can prevent many from doing so. Today, one in eight of the
  1.2 million Americans living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not know
  they are positive. For their study, the researchers analyzed two years of sales
  data for HIV test kit OraQuick, the only fast-acting at-home kit available in the
  US. They then compared those sales data against data from the same time period in
  years before and after. Advertisement What they found was astounding: Not only had
  sales increased 95% the week of Sheen''s disclosure, they also stayed relatively
  high for the four following weeks.It''s well-known that celebrities influence our
  behavior. Yet when it comes to health, it''s often not for the better . From splurging
  $200 on a breakfast smoothie infused with something called "moon dust" (looking
  at you, Gwyneth Paltrow) to subsisting on 14 jars of baby food in an attempt to
  lose weight (sorry, Reese Witherspoon), celebrities'' decisions about health can
  frequently be misguided at best. So it''s promising to see public figures potentially
  affecting health in a positive direction, the researchers write. Advertisement NOW

  health decision-making," they write, "and make an even stronger case that Sheen''s
  disclosure promoted HIV prevention, thanks to the availability of rapid in-home
  HIV testing."'
