article: 'Months After #MeToo, Millions Still Searching Online For Help Against Sexual
  Violence MedicalResearch.com Interview with: John W. Ayers, PhD, MA Vice Chief of
  Innovation | Assoc. Professor Div. Infectious Disease & Global Public Health University
  of California San Diego MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study?
  Response: The greatest barrier to understanding trends around sexual violence is
  they are largely hidden because victims are unable speak up publicly. Moreover,
  ongoing monitoring relies on proxies that underreport the scale of the problem such
  as police or medical records where only the most severe instances or a fraction
  of all instances of sexual violence are represented. As a result, we know very little
  about the scale of Americas sexual violence problem. It was this backdrop that inspired
  #MeToo to call on victims to publicly voice their stories thereby revealing the
  scale of the problem. Our goal was to, for the first time, assess how this change
  inspired the public to engage with sexual violence issues. By tracking private aggregate
  internet search query trends we can begin to understand the scale of public engagement
  with issues around sexual violence including the precise motivation for a search,
  such as reporting episodes of sexual violence or learning how to prevent sexual
  violence. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: Our study reveals
  that even months after the beginning of #MeToo millions more than otherwise expected
  are seeking out help for sexual violence online. Sexual harassment and/or assault
  searches increased 86 percent following the #MeToo movement and have remained higher
  for 8 months. Not only did searches for sexual harassment and/or assault significantly
  increase -- searches specific to training and reporting also increased 51 percent
  and 30 percent, respectively, indicating that people were potentially changing their
  behavior in the post #MeToo era. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away
  from your report? Response: Revealing this record setting and sustained engagement
  is a call to action for the nation. Survivors face serious health consequences including
  physical injury, PTSD symptoms, and emotional trauma. Yet, public investments in
  preventing and responding to sexual violence is disproportionately small compared
  with other health issues. With millions more than ever voicing their needs, our
  nations leaders should respond by investing in enhanced prevention training and
  improving resources for survivors. When victims seek out help online it is imperative
  they linked to evidenced based and effective resources. The same can be said for
  seeking out prevention resources. Investment in understanding these needs, developing
  responsive resources, and disseminating those resources are needed now. MedicalResearch.com:
  Is there anything else you would like to add? Response: MeToo is not the first movement
  to empower victims of sexual violence, but what is unique compared to past movements
  is #MeToos staying power. Eight months since the initiation of #MeToo millions more
  than expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. #MeToos sustainability,
  and our study alerting leaders to this, could yield major wins for the nations public
  health. Citation: Caputi TL, Nobles AL, Ayers JW. Internet Searches for Sexual Harassment
