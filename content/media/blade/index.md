article: 'Miami and Baltimore- Urban Health Media Project reporter Vanessa Falcon,
  a high school student in Miami, interviewed Arin Jayes, 30, of Baltimore, about
  his gender identity journey and experience transitioning to a non-binary trans man.
  Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist.
  Q: How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long
  did it last? A: As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals
  develop their gender identity. Its something that may evolve throughout a persons
  lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily
  changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many
  other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual
  orientation and class. For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong
  and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the "pronoun check"
  posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen
  over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story
  because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After
  all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender
  on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take.
  My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used
  "they/them" pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized
  that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends
  as a non-binary trans man, using "he" pronouns and physically transitioning. I made
  this decision with the understanding that I wasnt transitioning because I identified
  as a "man" per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine
  characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, Ive passed as male
  about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!)
  When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say "non-binary," and that
  my pronouns are "he or they -- either as fine." I am leaning into presenting as
  femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can
  be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine,
  because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if
  COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must
  consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls
  around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important.
  Q: Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative
  side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why?
  A: Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions
  I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didnt initially know what being transgender
  meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before
  I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to
  physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may
  experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek
  individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after
  weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I
  wanted, and my financial budget. Luckily, there is a lot of information and help
  available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities.
  For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people
  that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos
  or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically
  transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help
  people navigate the name and gender marker change process. One side effect that
  I didnt entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact
  that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go
  to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late
  at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, "Will people here
  be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?" As a white
  and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on
  systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color
  who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership -- and that of their
  successors in our movements -- must be recognized. Q: Did you have, or do you currently
  have, any regrets about transitioning? A: What I think this question is getting
  at is, "How do you know youre sure?" This was a question that I asked myself many
  times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes
  to my body. My answer to that is: I didnt truly know it was right until after I
  did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, "Why on earth would you do
  something so permanent if you werent sure?" But It took a leap of faith. And, as
  someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesnt feel right, you know. It
  is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to
  stop your physical transition, you dont need to think of it as "de-transitioning."
  The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots. Q: How has
  transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem
  and mental health? A: Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the
  challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the
  most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best
  ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient.
  Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think
  of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have
  had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power
  of our community. Q: What advice would you give to other people who want to follow
  the path you did? A: Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there
  are no rules! You dont have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition.
  Youre in the drivers seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live
  in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms
  you will occupy it. This article is part of our 2021 Youth Pride Issue in partnership
