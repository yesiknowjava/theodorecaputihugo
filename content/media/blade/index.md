summary: For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending!
  When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys
  that a person can take. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans
  man, using "he" pronouns and physically transitioning. Since physically transitioning
  seven years ago, Ive passed as male about 90% of the time. I decided to physically
  transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the
  changes that I wanted, and my financial budget.
