article: 'If you want to buy something -- anything, really -- its more than likely
  youll find it online. And that includes cannabis. Thats the conclusion of a new
  study published this week in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Millions
  of shoppers are searching for and finding online marijuana retailers across the
  country, according to the researchers. The team monitored Google searches in the
  United States between January 2005 and June 2017, including all searches with the
  terms marijuana, weed, pot, or cannabis combined with the terms buy, shop, or order
  (for example., "buy marijuana"). They omitted similar but irrelevant searches like
  "buy weed killer." The team then replicated the relevant searches and checked to
  see whether the resulting websites advertised mail-order marijuana. Related Story:

  Internet searches and search results, we were able to directly observe the online
  marijuana marketplace," said study co-author Mark Dredze, the John C. Malone Associate
  Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. The team found marijuana
  shopping searches nearly tripled in the United States from 2005 to 2017, peaking
  between 1.4 and 2.4 million searches each month. Marijuana shopping searches were
  highest in Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Nevada. However, the annual growth
  rate in searching for these terms increased in all but two states, Alabama and Mississippi,
  suggesting demand is accelerating across the nation. (The six least populated states
  were excluded from the study.) Forty-one percent of all search results linked to
  retailers advertising mail-order marijuana, promising delivery using a variety of
  methods including the United State Postal Service, commercial parcel companies such
  as UPS, or private courier. Moreover, mail-order marijuana retailers occupied half
  of the first-page results, and three out of every four searches resulted in a mail-order
  marijuana retailer as the very first suggested link. Related Story: Jane Technologies
  Will Make Shopping For Marijuana As Easy As Amazon "Anyone, including teenagers,
  can search for and buy marijuana from their smartphone regardless of what state
  they live in," said study leader John Ayers, an associate research professor at
  San Diego State Universitys School of Public Health. Such online sales of marijuana
  are prohibited in the United States, even in states that have legalized or partially
  legalized the drug, "but clearly these regulations are failing," said coauthor Eric
  Leas, a research fellow at Stanford University.'
