summary: 'Millions of shoppers are searching for and finding online marijuana retailers
  across the country, according to the researchers. The team monitored Google searches
  in the United States between January 2005 and June 2017, including all searches
  with the terms marijuana, weed, pot, or cannabis combined with the terms buy, shop,
  or order (for example., "buy marijuana"). Related Story: You Can Now Buy Legal Marijuana
  Online In Canada"By studying anonymized, aggregate Internet searches and search
  results, we were able to directly observe the online marijuana marketplace," said
  study co-author Mark Dredze, the John C. Malone Associate Professor of Computer
  Science at Johns Hopkins University. The team found marijuana shopping searches
  nearly tripled in the United States from 2005 to 2017, peaking between 1.4 and 2.4
  million searches each month. Moreover, mail-order marijuana retailers occupied half
  of the first-page results, and three out of every four searches resulted in a mail-order
  marijuana retailer as the very first suggested link.'
