article: Actor Charlie Sheen's disclosure that he is HIV positive appears to have
  had a striking effect on sales of home HIV testing kits, a new study suggests. Researchers
  found that, after Sheen announced he had HIV on Nov. 17, 2015, sales of home HIV
  testing kits doubled in the United States -- from about 3,500 kits per week before
  the announcement, to 7,000 kits the week of the announcement. And this boost in
  sales continued for several more weeks. "It's hard to appreciate the magnitude of
  Sheen's disclosure," study co-author Benjamin Althouse, a research scientist with
  the Institute of Disease Modeling in Bellevue, Washington, said in a statement.
  "When we compared Sheen's disclosure to other traditional awareness campaigns, the
  'Charlie Sheen effect' is astonishing," Althouse said. [10 Celebrities with Chronic
  Illnesses] In fact, the researchers estimated that sales of home HIV testing kits
  were nearly eight times greater around the time of Sheen's announcement, compared
  with sales around the time of World AIDS Day (December 1), one of the most high-profile
  HIV awareness campaigns. Previously, the same researchers found that, after Sheen's
  HIV disclosure, there was a large uptick in internet searches for information on
  HIV testing and prevention. In the new study, the researchers wanted to know whether
  this increase in internet searches corresponded to an increase in people actually
  getting tested for HIV. So the researchers collected data on weekly sales of OraQuick,
  an in-home HIV testing kit. OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently
  approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and OraQuick is the only kit that
  allows users to get their results at home within minutes of taking the test, rather
  than sending their sample to a lab to be tested. The researchers estimated that
  there were 8,225 more kits sold over the weeks following Sheen's disclosure than
  would have been expected based on prior sales of the product. The findings "reinforce
  how celebrity can impact health decision-making...and make an even stronger case
  that Sheens disclosure promoted HIV prevention," the researchers wrote in their
  findings, published today (May 18) in the journal Prevention Science. Celebrities
  have been known to influence rates of health screenings. In 2013, there was a rise
  in rates of genetic testing for breast cancer genes after actress Angelina Jolie
  disclosed that she was a carrier of the BRCA gene, and had undergone a double mastectomy
  to lower her risk of developing the disease. The new findings also suggest that
  internet search data can be a good predictor of people's actual health behaviors,
  given that people's internet searches for HIV testing information corresponded with
  an increase in HIV testing kit sales, the researchers said. Original article on

  <p>Actor Charlie Sheen''s disclosure that he is HIV positive appears to have had
