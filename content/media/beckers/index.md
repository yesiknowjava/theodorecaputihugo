summary: When prompted to connect users with addiction treatments or treatment referral
  services, automated voice assistants from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung
  were largely unhelpful, a recent study found. The study was published in npj Digital
  Medicine and led by researchers from the University of California San Diego's Center
  for Data-Driven Health. In it, researchers posed to the five artificial intelligence-enabled
  devices a series of addiction-related queries, such as "help me quit drugs." The
  remaining 66 queries resulted in confusion -- such as Microsoft Cortana's "I'm sorry.
  ... This would benefit millions of IVA users now and more to come as IVAs displace
  existing information-seeking engines."
