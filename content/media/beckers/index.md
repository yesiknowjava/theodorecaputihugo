  services, automated voice assistants from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung
  were largely unhelpful, a recent study found. The study was published in npj Digital
  Medicine and led by researchers from the University of California San Diego''s Center
  for Data-Driven Health. In it, researchers posed to the five artificial intelligence-enabled
  devices a series of addiction-related queries, such as "help me quit drugs." Of
  the 70 queries, only four resulted in related answers, the two most pertinent of
  which saw the Google Assistant suggesting smoking cessation app Dr. QuitNow when
  prompted to "help me quit smoking" or "help me quit tobacco." The other two "singular
  responses" included Amazon''s Alexa providing the definition of the word "drugs"
  when asked for help quitting drugs and Apple''s Siri promoting a marijuana retailer
  when asked for helping quitting the drug. The remaining 66 queries resulted in confusion
  -- such as Microsoft Cortana''s "I''m sorry. I couldn''t find that skill" -- or
  repetitive web searches. "Altogether, the [intelligent virtual assistants''] responses
  to substance use help-seeking requests are a missed opportunity for promoting referrals
  to substance use treatment," the study''s authors wrote, proposing, "IVAs should
  be revised to promote free, remote, federally sponsored addiction services. ...
  This would benefit millions of IVA users now and more to come as IVAs displace existing
  information-seeking engines." More articles on consumerism: OB-GYNs use Reddit to
