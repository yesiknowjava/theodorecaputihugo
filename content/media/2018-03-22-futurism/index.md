  unrelated or off-topic, such as "order weed killer." This left them with 12 terms

  percent relative to all searches on the internet. In June 2017, the numbers soared
  as *high* as 2.4 million in a single month. The searches werent restricted to particular

  This wouldnt be a problem if buying weed were the same as, say, buying shoes or
  electronics. Though nine states and Washington D.C. now permit recreational marijuana

  buying the weed. In states where marijuana is legal, buyers must be 21 or older,

  intervene to prevent these sales, perhaps by convincing internet service providers

  it. But as U.S. states relax their marijuana laws, the nation needs to take precautions
