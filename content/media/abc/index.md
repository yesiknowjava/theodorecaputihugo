summary: Searches for CBD spiked this year as awareness of the product grew. Following
  a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches
  for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018,
  according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year,
  with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month
  for which data is available. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for
  other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. "When people
  are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it
  is so high?"
