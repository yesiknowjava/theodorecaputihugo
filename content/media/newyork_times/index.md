summary: In a consumer update published recently, FDA said that current data suggest
  that CBD products pose human and animal safety concerns. But because many CBD products
  are not labeled or marketed for medical use, FDA does not evaluate the products
  before they enter the market. These companies allegedly marketed their CBD products
  as drugs without FDA evaluating or approving the products. But in the process of
  evaluating the drug, FDA identified many safety concerns associated with CBD, suggesting
  that CBD products may not be safe for the general public. To address these safety
  concerns but also allow research to develop, FDA held a public hearing last spring
  to gather data about CBD products quality, safety, and manufacturing processes.
