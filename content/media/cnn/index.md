summary: (CNN) LGBQ teens are more vulnerable to planning or attempting suicide, according
  to a research letter published Tuesday in the journal JAMA. Transgender teens were
  not included in the US government's survey, but research has shown that transgender
  youth may face a similarly high, if not higher, suicide risk. Of the sexual minorities
  in the study, 34.9% were planning suicide and 24.9% had attempted suicide in the
  previous year. The children who were bisexual faced the greatest suicide risk; 46%
  had considered suicide in the past year. More than 40% said they seriously considered
  suicide in the past year; in comparison, 19.6% of girls who considered themselves
  heterosexual said they had seriously considered suicide in the past year.
