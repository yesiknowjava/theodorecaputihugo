article: 'To a certain approximation, awareness is overrated: That is, as a general
  rule, educating people about problems in the world is unlikely to nudge their behavior
  or their views all that significantly. But there are exceptions to that rule, and
  one of the more interesting classes of exceptions occurs when theres a big, high-profile
  event that focuses a lot of media attention on a particular problem. John Ayers,
  a San Diego State University computational epidemiologist with a behavioral-science
  bent, has done a lot of work with his colleagues studying the effects of these events
  on Google search terms. One such example came in November 2015, when Charlie Sheen
  announced on the Today show that he was HIV-positive, and that the treatment he
  had received for the virus had rendered it undetectable in his blood. It was one
  of those media events that focused a huge amount of attention on one public figure
  and one very important public-health issue. And it left a behavioral mark -- at
  least on Google. A few months later, in a JAMA Internal Medicine study that Science
  of Us covered, Ayers and his colleagues found that Sheens announcement appeared
  to have caused a massive uptick in Google searches pertaining to HIV testing and
  condoms. As I noted at the time, such a search spike suggested, but didnt prove
  on its own, that Sheens high-profile interview may have saved some lives by leading
  some people to change their behavior: "The big question, of course, is what percentage
  of these searches will lead to action -- to the querier getting tested or having
  safer sex." Thats what Ayers and his colleagues sought to find out for a new study
  just published in Prevention Science. Rather than just examine search-term volume,
  the researchers looked at sales data for OraQuick, which is apparently the only
  rapid-result HIV testing kit available in the United States. Sure enough: Thats
  a big jump. And it lends a lot of credence to the idea that some high-profile events
  really can cause massive, albeit probably temporary, changes in behavior -- sometimes,
  as in this case, life-saving ones. So maybe its time for a parenthetical addendum:
  Awareness is overrated (usually).'

  <p>To a certain approximation, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/07/awareness-is-overrated.html">awareness
  is overrated</a>: That is, as a general rule, educating people about problems in
  the world is unlikely to nudge their behavior or their views all that significantly.
  But there are exceptions to that rule, and one of the more interesting classes of
  exceptions occurs when there&rsquo;s a big, high-profile event that focuses a lot
  of media attention on a particular problem.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.johnwayers.com/">John Ayers</a>, a San Diego State University
  computational epidemiologist with a behavioral-science bent, has done a lot of work
  with his colleagues studying the effects of these events on Google search terms.
  One such example came in November 2015, when Charlie Sheen <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/11/what-charlie-sheens-hiv-diagnosis-can-teach-us.html">announced
  on the <em>Today </em>show that he was HIV-positive</a>, and that the treatment
  he had received for the virus had rendered it undetectable in his blood. It was
  one of those media events that focused a huge amount of attention on one public
  figure and one very important public-health issue.</p>

  <p>And it left a behavioral mark &mdash; at least on Google. A few months later,
  in a <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2495274"><em>JAMA
