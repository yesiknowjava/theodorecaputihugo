summary: 'These data underscore the scope of sexual assault and harassment in the
  United States and reflect a need for structural-level interventions. Search volumes
  were reported as a ratio of all Google searches and were adjusted for changes in
  Google use over time. A counterfactual scenario was manufactured from predicted
  search volumes, thus providing "expected" query numbers for comparison. Observed
  search volumes remained higher than expected for 8 months following the initiation
  of #MeToo. Internet searches for sexual harassment and assault, reporting, and training
  since the #MeToo movement [published online December 21, 2018].'
