summary: 'Hailed as a "healthier" alternative to traditional fags, the heat-not-burn
  devices are set explode in popularity, experts said today. Heat-not-burn devices
  are currently only on sale in a handful of places around the world, and so little
  is known about their appeal. The study''s co-author, Professor Mark Dredze from
  Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said: "Heat-not-burn products have quickly
  become insanely popular. The study authors added: "This suggests that as heat-not-burn
  tobacco is introduced in new markets, its popularity may even eclipse e-cigarettes."
  Public Health England and the Royal College of Physicians believe it is in the interests
  of public health to promote the use of e-cigs as a way to encourage smokers to quit.'
