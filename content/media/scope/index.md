summary: In 2014, a new type of tobacco product, a heat-not-burn cigarette, was marketed
  to the people of Japan. These battery-powered cigarettes heat tobacco to roughly
  500 degrees Fahrenheit, releasing an ashless, smokeless aerosol that contains nicotine.
  According to a new study that used Google search query data to estimate the scale
  and growth potential of heat-not-burn tobacco products, interest in heat-not-burn
  cigarettes is already growing faster in Japan than it did for e-cigarettes when
  they first emerged on the market. These findings suggest the popularity of heat-not-burn
  cigarettes could quickly eclipse that of e-cigarettes if they're introduced to markets
  in other countries. "There is   a   tremendous   amount   we   need   to   learn   about   heat-not-burn   tobacco."
