article: 'Font Size: A A A FDA warns consumers that the agency has not evaluated most
  CBD products and cannot say they are safe. Font Size: A A A Celebrities are promoting
  cannabis derived products as part of a growing wellness trend. Kim Kardashian had
  a cannabidiol (CBD) themed baby shower. Melissa McCarthy used CBD oil to relieve
  foot pain. Whoopi Goldberg started selling CBD infused products to alleviate "menstrual
  discomfort." But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the public
  that CBD products have not been approved by the agency and can expose consumers
  to serious health risks. In a consumer update published recently, FDA said that
  current data suggest that CBD products pose human and animal safety concerns. FDA
  recognized that limited information exists on the long-term safety and quality of
  CBD products, but stated that the available research indicates that the substance
  can cause liver damage, interact with other medications, and lead to other adverse
  side effects. Although CBD can be sold legally in the United States, the products
  do not undergo FDAs extensive drug approval process. Under the Federal Food, Drug,
  and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), substances are considered drugs if they are intended for
  therapeutic or medical use or are supposed to affect the structure or function of
  the body. But because many CBD products are not labeled or marketed for medical
  use, FDA does not evaluate the products before they enter the market. Due to FDAs
  limited data, the agency said it cannot conclude that CBD products are safe. In
  a press release accompanying the agencys consumer update, Amy Abernethy, Principal
  Deputy Commissioner of FDA, said, "we remain concerned that some people wrongly
  think that the myriad of CBD products on the market, many of which are illegal,
  have been evaluated by the FDA and determined to be safe, or that trying CBD ''cant
  hurt." FDAs recent announcements were released in response to CBDs growing popularity
  and mainstream use. Although CBD--a compound extracted from marijuana or hemp plants--does
  not produce the "high" commonly associated with marijuana, it has been marketed
  for its purported health and wellness benefits. Based on limited studies, the substance
  has been advertised to improve overall wellness by helping with common conditions
  such as insomnia, chronic pain, and anxiety. Preliminary data have also suggested
  that CBD may possibly treat certain types of cancer. These potential health benefits
  have captured the publics interest. According to a recent study, in April of 2019
  alone there were 6.4 million Google searches for CBD. Numerous consumers have shared
  stories on social media about how they believe CBD has helped them manage their
  pain or improve their anxiety. The availability of CBD also increased over the past
  year. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 legalized hemp production, allowing
  producers to cultivate hemp and extract CBD for commercial products. It is estimated
  that, by 2022, the CBD market will have grown about 40 times the size of the 2018
  market. Although consumers can find CBD oils, foods, creams, and beverages for sale,
  FDA cautioned that some of the companies selling such products are making illegal
  health claims. FDA recently issued warning letters to 15 companies for violating
  the FDCA. These companies allegedly marketed their CBD products as drugs without
  FDA evaluating or approving the products. The agency said that these misleading
  claims are a public health concern because people may delay seeking medical care
  if they think their illnesses can be managed or treated with CBD products. FDA has
  only approved a single CBD product--a prescription drug that can treat two rare
  forms of epilepsy. In granting its approval, the agency recognized that the benefits
  of the drug outweighed the potential risks to the specific patient population. But
  in the process of evaluating the drug, FDA identified many safety concerns associated
  with CBD, suggesting that CBD products may not be safe for the general public. For
  example, FDA noted during the epilepsy drug approval process that patients showed
  signs of liver damage. Over time, this damage could lead to liver failure, a potentially
  fatal diagnosis. The agency also warned that CBD can interact with other drugs,
  reducing the effectiveness of other medications and causing adverse side effects.
  These health risks can occur without a consumer realizing that damage is accumulating.
  The agency recognized that these risks can be controlled if a physician is monitoring
  the CBD dosage and the patients condition. But widespread commercial use is dangerous
  because consumers are not being tested for potential side effects or screened for
  drug interactions. FDA also identified areas where more research is needed. The
  agency said it is "actively" working to determine if the products are safe for "special
  populations," such as children, elderly, or pregnant or lactating women. It is also
  unclear whether CBD produces side effects from long-term use. To address these safety
  concerns but also allow research to develop, FDA held a public hearing last spring
  to gather data about CBD products quality, safety, and manufacturing processes.
  FDA received over 4,000 comments in connection with the hearing. Many individuals
  shared personal stories of how CBD has helped them manage chronic conditions like
  anxiety or inflammation. Manufacturers cited research showing CBDs medicinal properties
  and asked FDA to provide a clear regulatory framework to encourage further research.
  One pharmaceutical company urged FDA to establish uniform testing and labeling requirements
  and remove inconsistencies between state and local regulations. A federal framework
  would provide companies with greater guidance on how to research and develop new
  products that have therapeutic value, the company asserted. FDA has acknowledged
  that CBDs regulatory framework needs to be modified and agency officials have discussed
  whether further legislation is needed. "We recognize the significant public interest
  in CBD and we must work together with stakeholders and industry to fill in the knowledge
  gaps about the science, safety and quality of many of these products," Abernethy
  stated.'
