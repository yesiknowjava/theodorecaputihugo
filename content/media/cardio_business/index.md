summary: The smoking alternative has exploded in Japan, where average monthly searches
  for heat-not-burn tobacco products rose 1,426 percent between 2015 and 2016, but
  clinicians are largely unaware of its cardiovascular risks. "We do not know the
  health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco," Caputi said in an email. Caputi and
  colleagues compared search queries for heat-not-burn products in Japan to Google
  searches for e-cigarettes in the U.S., since e-cigarettes arent legal in Japan.
  Heat-not-burn searches occurred more frequently in Japan than e-cigarette searches
  did in the U.S., the authors reported, with the first queries for heat-not-burn
  cigarettes eclipsing e-cigarettes in April 2016. While its too early to tell if
  heat-not-burn products will overtake e-cigarettes as the new method of smoking,
  the available evidence suggests heat-not-burn products are poised for explosive
  growth as they are introduced into new markets."
