article: (CNN) When celebrities speak, it seems, the world listens -- even when it
  comes to personal and public health. Just look at what happened after Charlie Sheen's
  HIV disclosure two years ago, said John Ayers , a research professor at San Diego
  State University. Sales of in-home HIV testing kits reached record highs around
  the same time the actor announced that he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive in
  2015, according to a study published in the journal Prevention Science on Thursday.
  Ayers was a co-author of the study. About the same time, "in record numbers, people
  were going online, seeking out information on what the signs of HIV are, on how
  to find and appropriately prevent HIV with devices such as condoms and also how
  to get tested,'" Ayers said. "We've seen this ... many times over." For the new
  study, Ayers and his co-authors monitored weekly sales of OraQuick, the only FDA-approved
  at-home oral HIV testing kit available in the United States, from 2014 to 2016.
  The researchers found that there were 8,225 more sales than they expected the week
  of Sheen's HIV status announcement. Elevated sales continued for four weeks after
  Sheen's disclosure. The findings show a correlation, not a direct causation. Yet
  in a previous study, Ayers and his colleagues also found that Google searches for
  HIV testing and related topics also spiked after Sheen's announcement. "The most
  common reaction is, 'So what? What does a search really mean?' Our new study shows
  not only did Sheen's disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention,
  it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales," Ayers
  said. Though they are not doctors, many celebrities have had both positive and negative
  ties to public health in recent years. When celebrities open up about their health
  "The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being
  HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV," said Steven Hoffman,
  scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and
  director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. In 1991, when most people
  didn't have much information about the virus and the Internet was not commonly used,
  the American basketball star announced that he had tested positive for HIV and retired
  from the NBA. "Here was a very prominent athlete who is publicly disclosing being
  HIV-positive and opening up conversation around it for people," said Hoffman, who
  was not involved in the latest study. "I think that's an example highlighting the
  positive role that celebrity can play in informing health decisions." Yet while
  Johnson's HIV disclosure spurred questions and conversations, since the virus was
  still unfamiliar, Sheen's disclosure was linked to action, Ayers said. After Sheen's
  announcement, about 1.25 million people in the United States searched online for
  topics directly related to condoms, HIV symptoms or HIV testing, according to Ayers'
  previous study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine last year. That
  study involved analyzing Google Trends and search term data from 2004 through November
  2015, which included when Sheen disclosed his HIV status on November 17, 2015. The
  researchers found that Sheen's announcement corresponded with the greatest number
  of HIV-related Google searchers ever recorded in the US. But Sheen didn't make an
  immediate call to action for the public to get tested or use condoms, and public
  health groups didn't use him as a face to raise HIV awareness. JUST WATCHED Celebrities

  the celebrity or public health leaders calling for action -- the public appeared
  to still respond based on health information that was widely known, Ayers said.
  "When Magic Johnson made his disclosure, there wasn't a similar reaction. There
  couldn't be, because people didn't know what to do," Ayers said. "Remember, people
  (were) asking, 'Can he play basketball?' 'Can I shake his hand?' There wasn't this
  trove of information about HIV, HIV prevention and HIV testing. When Sheen disclosed,
  there was this trove of information," he said. "We saw people seeking out information
  on the signs of HIV, HIV testing and how to prevent HIV by using condoms. We saw
  this trilogy of reaction that is fairly consistent with what public health has been
  promoting for 20-plus years." JUST WATCHED The 'Angelina effect' on cancer Replay

  associate professor of health communication at North Carolina State University,
  said that she believes actress Angelina Jolie's 2013 announcement of a double mastectomy
  to prevent breast cancer also had a positive influence on public health, despite
  possibly influencing an uptick in unnecessary genetic testing. Kosenko led a study
  in which 229 women were surveyed immediately after Jolie's announcement to undergo
  a double mastectomy. Researchers looked at whether Jolie influenced the women's
  genetic testing intentions. JUST WATCHED Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion

  06:07 The study, published in the Journal of Health Communication last year, showed
  that 30% of the women intended to get tested to see whether they carried the BRCA1
  gene, 23% said they would probably get tested, and 7% said they would definitely
  get tested. The others reported that they would not get tested. Kosenko said that
  separate studies demonstrated increased genetic testing requests and Internet searches
  related to BRCA1 after Jolie's announcement. "We rely heavily on friends and family
  for health information, and we tend to see certain celebrities as friends. Unfortunately,
  we do not share the same resources as these famous 'friends,' which impacts our
  ability to follow celebrity health advice," she said. "For example, at the time
  of Jolie's announcement, the genetic tests she underwent were prohibitively expensive
  for the average American." There are examples of celebrities having a potentially
  harmful influence on public health too, said Hoffman, director of the University
  of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. 'I do blame celebrities' "The most prominent example
  of harm would be, in my mind, Jenny McCarthy," Hoffman said. The American actress
  has been a vocal autism activist, spreading concerns that autism might be associated
  with childhood vaccines. McCarthy was unavailable for comment, but her representative
  said she addressed her stance on vaccines in an op-ed published in the Chicago Sun-Times
  in 2014, headlined "The gray area on vaccines." Her son, Evan, was diagnosed with
  autism . She believes that doctors should change some children's vaccine schedules,
  such as allowing for one shot per doctor's visit instead of multiple shots, she
  wrote in the op-ed. "I am not 'anti-vaccine.' This is not a change in my stance
  nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly
  stated that I am, in fact, 'pro-vaccine' and for years I have been wrongly branded
  as 'anti-vaccine,' " McCarthy wrote. "My beautiful son, Evan, inspired this mother
  to question the 'one size fits all' philosophy of the recommended vaccine schedule,"
  she wrote. "I embarked on this quest not only for myself and my family, but for
  countless parents who shared my desire for knowledge that could lead to options
  and alternate schedules, but never to eliminate the vaccines." "She is actually
  recommending practices that are unhealthful and potentially dangerous," Hoffman
  said about McCarthy's stance on changing vaccine schedules. "Recommending to people
  not to vaccinate their children means not only are the children being subjected
  to unnecessary harm, but many others around those children who might not be able
  to get vaccinated for legitimate reasons are put at an additional risk ask well,"
  he said. "It's not only unfair to the children who aren't being vaccinated, but
  also to the many people who can't be vaccinated, who interact with those children."
  Even though they are vulnerable to illness, some people may not be able to get certain
  vaccines based on age, an allergy or pre-existing health condition, or other factors,
  according to the CDC Public health experts also have accused actress Gwyneth Paltrow
  of spreading some questionable health tips through her lifestyle blog, goop. In
  a written statement, goop spokeswoman Noora Raj Brown described the website as pushing
  "new ideas into the conversation" in health and wellness. "We have a disclaimer
  on the bottom of every article that states the purpose is to highlight alternative
  studies and induce conversation. It's not a substitute for professional medical
  advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The views of the experts profiled don't necessarily
  represent the views of goop," the statement said. One blog post on goop recommended
  inserting a rock, called a jade egg, into your vagina to improve your sex life and
  orgasms, among other benefits. Some experts have said that not thoroughly cleaning
  or sterilizing the jade egg could lead to infection , or that it could get stuck.
  "In many cases, there are opposing opinions on issues -- like the jade eggs for
  example -- and our role is to service the conversation," Brown said. "Gwyneth Paltrow's
  messages, it's mostly that she's recommending practices that don't work," Hoffman
  said. "The biggest harm is the loss or waste of money and the misplaced attention
  away from practices that actually work." jade egg on goop costs about $66. Hoffman
  said that the money could be better spent on buying nutritious foods or a gym membership.
  "Do celebrities have an impact on health outcomes? We know they do. ... There's
  so many studies out there that have demonstrated that when celebrities either give
  helpful or harmful advice to people, it's routinely followed," Hoffman said. "I
  do blame celebrities, because they need to recognize the impact they can have and
  the potential harm that can result from it," he said. "I definitely blame those
  who are spreading misinformation." How celebrities have hacked public health talks
  Hoffman and his colleagues published a review paper in the British Medical Journal
  to analyze the influence celebrities have on people's health decisions through the
  factors of economics, marketing, psychology and sociology. "In marketing literature,
  they talk about a halo effect around celebrities, whereby people have a very positive
  view of celebrities, and when celebrities endorse a product or recommend a particular
  health practice, it transfers their golden glow from the celebrity to the products
  or practice," Hoffman said. "In economics literature, there's recognition of something
  called signaling, which is whereby in a marketplace filled with competing ideas,
  people are constantly looking for a shortcut in order to identify which products
  or practices they should be following, and so a celebrity endorsing a product provides
  a cognitive shortcut to an otherwise very complicated decision," he said. "There
  is increasing recognition of the role of social networks, and there's few people
  who have bigger social networks than celebrities. Just think of the number of Twitter
  followers some celebrities have cultivated." However, Ayers, author of the latest
  study, said it might not be that complicated. "It's not so much about a celebrity
  effect," he said, adding that when celebrities speak out about health-related issues,
  it may resonate because they are speaking as humans with just as much vulnerability
  to health impacts as anyone else. "Typically, public health uses top-down strategies.
  The most effective messages are believed to come from the experts, 'from the top.'
  The people who know the most about the subject, the people who are paid to sit around
  and think about the subject," Ayers said. "It turns out, though, that if you look
  at the Sheen effect and if you look at these other examples of organic media events
  ... that's not the case. These messages, they come from the bottom; they come from
  ordinary people. People who aren't health experts. Sheen might be a celebrity, but
  he's not a health expert. Angelina Jolie is not a health expert," he said. All in
  all, Hoffman said, public health officials could work with celebrities to harness
  their fame to spread evidence-based health information and mitigate the spread of
  misinformation. He cited supermodel Christy Turlington Burns as a positive example
  of a celebrity working with public health authorities to promote positive health
  practices. She served as a spokeswoman in CDC promotional ads raising awareness
  about smoking cessation and the health risks of smoking. Join the conversation See

  Ayers said he saw public health officials utilize the power of Sheen's celebrity
  in real time, not during but after his HIV announcement. "It turns out that actually
  because of our study, we got to see those things happen. When we published our study,
  a few weeks later, Charlie Sheen began speaking out about HIV prevention, particularly
  condoms, and he cited our study as one of the reasons for doing that," Ayers said
  of the study on Google searches. "We also saw several leading organizations in HIV
  prevention begin to use Charlie Sheen's disclosure as a way to promote HIV prevention."
  Hoffman said it would be beneficial to see more examples of celebrities and public
  health leaders working together in the future. "I think there probably are a lot
  of celebrities who want to do good and would be open to the idea of working with
  public health officials to do good," he said. "We just need to still figure out
  the best way of doing that, in terms of what would be most effective." For now,
  to make informed health decisions, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the
  American Public Health Association, offered some guidance in an email. "Get a second
  opinion," he wrote. "Trust but verify celebrity statements from trusted health sources
  like the American Cancer Society, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,
  APHA, American Academy of Pediatrics" and others.
