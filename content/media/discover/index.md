summary: The IQOS smokeless tobacco product. Heat-not-burn tobacco products have stepped
  into that space, promising a nicotine-rich rush of vapor that's free of the carcinogens
  that traditional cigarettes deliver. It's already popular in Japan, and tobacco
  companies are seeking to gain approval for their products here in the U.S. That's
  compared to the many thousands on tobacco, nicotine and cigarettes. Heat-not-burn
  products, with their slick packaging and nominally healthier technology, could find
  a solid foothold here as well.
