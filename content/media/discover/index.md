  Smoking: It''s bad for you. Take the smoke out of smoking, though, and you might
  be on to something. That, at least, is the thought process behind newly-emerging
  smokeless forms of nicotine, the most prominent right now being e-cigarettes. A
  vape pen just doesn''t deliver the same sweet rush of nicotine and the satisfying
  "throat hit" smokers crave, though, leaving tobacco companies searching for a better
  option. Heat-not-burn tobacco products have stepped into that space, promising a
  nicotine-rich rush of vapor that''s free of the carcinogens that traditional cigarettes
  deliver. It''s already popular in Japan, and tobacco companies are seeking to gain
  approval for their products here in the U.S. It''s Toasted Philip Morris, which
  produces the Marlboro brand, has seen sales of its IQOS device in Japan far outpace
  its production capabilities in the past few years. The pen-sized device uses a small
  heating blade to warm a plug of tobacco to a over 600 degrees Fahrenheit, not hot
  enough to ignite it, but sufficient to produce a nicotine-laced vapor which the
  user can inhale. The product is a healthier alternative to their cigarettes, the
  company claims. A new study from public health researcher John Ayers in the journal
  PLOS ONE suggests that the market for heat-not-burn tobacco products could soon
  ignite in the U.S. and highlights the lack of research into the effects these products
  could have on our bodies. Just 26 studies reference heat-not-burn products, according
  to the press release. That''s compared to the many thousands on tobacco, nicotine
  and cigarettes. Though the products are held to be less dangerous than cigarettes
  because they do not involve smoke, there''s not a lot of research to back that up.
  The few studies of the device thus far agree, but with a caveat: Heating and inhaling
  tobacco in this manner still produces harmful chemicals. It might not harm you as
  much as a cigarette would, but it''s still detrimental to your health. Philip Morris
  has been strongly critical of such research, going so far as to send letters to
  the heads of universities whose researchers published a study this year examining
  heat-not-burn products, reports the Washington Post. Those researchers refused to
  even talk to the paper. Fizzles and Starts Electronic devices that heat tobacco
  to produce vapor aren''t a new idea, either. Similar products have been around since
  the 1980s, although consumers then weren''t as excited, and the technology never
  took hold. Philip Morris developed a device called the Accord utilizing the same
  basic concept in the 90s, and rival RJ Reynolds attempted something similar with
  the Eclipse. Preliminary studies at the time found much the same thing as research
  today -- it might be a bit better for you, but it''s not safe. Philip Morris points
  to its own research into the matter -- carried out at its glittering new facility
  in Switzerland -- showing the relative merits of devices like the IQOS and highlighting
  the lowered levels of chemicals. The study that attracted their ire last year, from
  Swiss researchers, showed higher levels of most dangerous chemicals than the company
  reported in its own work, though. Controversy notwithstanding, the IQOS seems poised
  to appeal to a market of younger customers wary of cigarettes but open to alternative
  forms of nicotine consumption. A 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human
  Services found that vaping had surpassed cigarette use among younger users, and
  those totals will likely rise. Heat-not-burn products, with their slick packaging
  and nominally healthier technology, could find a solid foothold here as well. Ayers''
  report doesn''t necessarily recommend banning or even heavily restricting the devices.
  It''s instead a warning to researchers that the data is lagging behind the cultural
  zeitgeist. Tobacco companies have a well-established history of lying to consumers
  and promising healthier alternatives -- for example, "light cigarettes" -- and the
  same could happen here. With indications that these devices are still harmful, though
  not as much as cigarettes, consumers are at risk of being deceived by marketing
  campaigns that take advantage of a lack of context and murky research to push an
  unsafe product. There''s also a debate to be had about whether promoting a product
  that''s a little safer versus pursuing complete eradication is best. There''s no
  definitive answer for that question when it comes to smoking yet, in part because
  we don''t even have the data to begin looking at it clearly.'
