article: '(Reuters Health) - - Millions of Americans have searched Google for information
  on how to understand, prevent and report sexual harassment and assault since the
  start of the #MeToo movement more than a year ago, a U.S. study suggests. FILE PHOTO:

  Nicholson In October 2017, following public accusations of sexual harassment and
  assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein, actress Alyssa Milano encouraged
  victims to bring the taboo topic out of the shadows by sharing their own stories
  on social media. The resulting #MeToo movement resulted in widespread sharing on
  social media, and the new study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, offers fresh
  evidence that the movement has contributed to a shift in public thinking about these
  issues, said senior author John Ayers of the University of California, San Diego.
  "#MeToo is not the first movement to empower victims of sexual violence, but what
  is unique compared to past movements is #MeToos staying power," Ayers said by email.
  For the study, researchers monitored the volume of Google searches originating in
  the U.S. from January 1, 2010 through June 15, 2018 related to sexual harassment
  and assault. During the last eight months of the study period - after #MeToo began
  - there were 40 to 54 million Google searches related to sexual harassment or assault,
  the greatest number of searches on this topic ever recorded in the U.S., the study
  found. Overall volume for this topic was 86 percent higher during these eight months
  than what researchers calculated would have occurred in the absence of #MeToo based
  on their analysis of the earlier years of the study. Searches related specifically
  to reporting sexual harassment and assault were 30 percent higher than expected
  over the last eight months of the study. And searches related to preventive training
  for sexual harassment and assault were 51 percent higher than expected. These results
  suggest that #MeToo may have reduced the stigma of reporting or discussing sexual
  harassment and assault, the authors conclude. Google searches may also help connect
  victims with needed support and health resources, Ayers said. "Survivors face serious
  health consequences including physical injury, PTSD symptoms, and emotional trauma,"
  Ayers said. "Yet, public investments in preventing and responding to sexual violence
  is disproportionately small compared with other health issues." However, the authors
  note, online activity is only a proxy for public engagement with topics like sexual
  harassment and assault, and more research is needed to determine whether or how
  the surge in Google activity might relate to meaningful shifts in public opinion
  or behavior. Its also unclear whether surges in search activity related to sexual
  harassment and assault were sustained only by the #MeToo movement on social media
  or related also to media coverage of accusations against high-profile men across
  a wide range of industries, said Luis Rocha, a researcher at the School of Informatics
  & Computing at Indiana University in Bloomington. "This is all new territory and
  only time will tell with future studies," Rocha, who wasnt involved in the study,
  said by email. "I would think that what people do online will lead to greater awareness
  that can in turn lead to changes in workplace environments," Rocha added. "If people
  are searching online in great volumes for the topic, it means they are interested
  (even if pinged by the media) in the topic, so I would expect this to have very
  real impact in all aspects of their lives." SOURCE: bit.ly/2EIL2LA JAMA Internal
