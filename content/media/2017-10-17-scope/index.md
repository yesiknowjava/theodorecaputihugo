article: In 2014, a new type of tobacco product, a heat-not-burn cigarette, was marketed
  to the people of Japan. These battery-powered cigarettes heat tobacco to roughly
  500 degrees Fahrenheit, releasing an ashless, smokeless aerosol that contains nicotine.
  According to a new study that used Google search query data to estimate the scale
  and growth potential of heat-not-burn tobacco products, interest in heat-not-burn
  cigarettes is already growing faster in Japan than it did for e-cigarettes when
  they first emerged on the market. "Two years ago, there were essentially no queries
  in Japan for heat-not-burn tobacco, but now there are between 5.9 and 7.5   million   each   month,"
  said study co-author Mark Dredze, PhD, in a press release. These findings suggest
  the popularity of heat-not-burn cigarettes could quickly eclipse that of e-cigarettes
  if they're introduced to markets in other countries. Yet, relatively little is known
  about heat-not burn cigarettes or their safety. "In the entire  PubMed database--which
  catalogues millions of public health studies--just 26 studies even mention heat-not-burn
  tobacco," said  study co-author Eric Leas, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at the
  Stanford Prevention Research Center in the press release. "There is   a   tremendous   amount   we   need   to   learn   about   heat-not-burn   tobacco."

  \ study and its implications for Phillip Morris' heat-not-burn product, called iQOS,\
  \ which is under review with the FDA for marketing and distribution and may soon\
  \ be introduced in the U.S..</p>\n<p><strong>What is the main appeal of heat-not-burn\
  \ cigarettes? </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>The main appeal of heat-not-burn cigarettes\
  \ is the delivery of the &ldquo;throat-hit&rdquo; of combustible cigarettes without\
  \ the combustion. This type of hit is not achieved by most e-cigarette and vaping\
  \ devices.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why do you think heat-not-burn cigarettes\
  \ have the potential to be popular in the U.S.?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Heat-not-burn\
  \ products are taking off in markets they've been introduced into around the world\
  \ [and] there is also clearly a demand for &quot;safer&quot; tobacco products in\
  \ the United States. This has been seen mainly in the major growth in e-cigarette\
  \ use over the last 5 years, but is also seen even among cigarette brands. For instance,\
  \ in a recent <a href=\"https://goo.gl/AbdSqe\">report</a> we showed that more than\
  \ 2.5 million U.S. smokers use a brand of cigarettes that they believe might be\
  \ &quot;less harmful.&quot;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>The FDA's <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm568923.htm\"\
  >new plan</a> for tobacco and nicotine regulation aims to reduce nicotine in combustible\
  \ cigarettes, while giving newly regulated combustible and non-combustible tobacco\
  \ products extended deadlines to apply for review. How might this affect the review\
  \ process for heat-not-burn cigarettes? </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>It's too early\
  \ for me to know what impact, if any, that new plan will have on heat-not-burn products.\
  \ What I do know is that PMI [Phillip Morris International] is going through the\
  \ &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/TobaccoProductReviewEvaluation/ucm304465.htm\"\
  >modified risk tobacco product</a>&quot; permitting process, which is different\
  \ than the premarket process for other tobacco products. In this process, the manufacturer\
  \ attempts to provide evidence that their product has reduced health risks compared\
  \ to similar types of tobacco products on the market. Upon completion the manufacturer\
  \ can make claims of reduce-harm in their marketing.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>In\
  \ your paper, you and your co-authors recommend &quot;traditional surveillance strategies&quot;\
  \ to monitor heat-not-burn markets. What would this would entail? </strong></p>\n\
  <blockquote><p>Adding questions about heat-not-burn cigarettes to surveys to understand\
  \ use and perceptions of these products among the general population. For instance,\
  \ these items could be added to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [a\
  \ nationwide health-related telephone survey system that collects data from U.S.\
  \ residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions\
  \ and use of preventive service] which is run by the U.S. Center for Disease Control\
  \ and Prevention.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Your team's <a href=\"https://id.elsevier.com/ACW/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com%2Faction%2FconsumeSsoCookie%3FredirectUri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ajpmonline.org%252Faction%252FconsumeSharedSessionAction%253FJSESSIONID%253Daaafg9fVkS9-A8zV3qE8v%2526MAID%253DmtXTDmS%25252FqWP8Ch5BKIaWpQ%25253D%25253D%2526SERVER%253DWZ6myaEXBLGZpQFlLdJmhw%25253D%25253D%2526ORIGIN%253D29944533%2526RD%253DRD\"\
