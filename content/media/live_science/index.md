summary: Actor Charlie Sheen's disclosure that he is HIV positive appears to have
  had a striking effect on sales of home HIV testing kits, a new study suggests. "It's
  hard to appreciate the magnitude of Sheen's disclosure," study co-author Benjamin
  Althouse, a research scientist with the Institute of Disease Modeling in Bellevue,
  Washington, said in a statement. "When we compared Sheen's disclosure to other traditional
  awareness campaigns, the 'Charlie Sheen effect' is astonishing," Althouse said.
  Previously, the same researchers found that, after Sheen's HIV disclosure, there
  was a large uptick in internet searches for information on HIV testing and prevention.
  So the researchers collected data on weekly sales of OraQuick, an in-home HIV testing
  kit.
