article: A team of American doctors has highlighted the key role that virtual assistants
  could play in helping to prevent addiction. The researchers suggest, for example,
  that they could instruct smartphone users to avail of free treatment referral services.
  Smartphone virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri and Bixby are handy when you want
  to consult tomorrow's weather forecast, find the nearest open pharmacy or access
  a list of movie times. But can they help you stop smoking and drinking? This is
  the question that a group of medical professors at the University of California,
  San Diego, decided to explore. "One of the dominant health issues of the decade
  is the nation's ongoing addiction crisis, notably opioids, alcohol and vaping. As
  a result, it is an ideal case study to begin exploring the ability of intelligent
  virtual assistants to provide actionable answers for obvious health questions,"
  explains Dr. John Ayers, the co-author of the study. The team of doctors conducted
  a test in which they successively questioned Alexa (Amazon), Siri (Apple), Google
  Assistant, Cortana (Microsoft) and Bixby (Samsung), asking among other things for
  help to stop drinking and smoking. In response to 70 help-seeking queries, the intelligent
  virtual assistants returned only four useful replies. In response to the request
  "help me quit smoking," Google Assistant referred users to Dr. QuitNow, an American
  smoking cessation app. The rest of the time, the virtual assistants did not seem
  to understand the questions they were asked. Directing users to 1-800 helplines
  So there is still plenty of work to be done before smartphones can replace doctors.
  However, the authors of the research study published in NPJ Digital Medicine believe
  that changes to smartphone settings could enable them to provide better quality
  medical assistance for addictions. "We can encourage people to take the first step
  towards treatment by having intelligent virtual assistants promote 1-800 helplines,"
  Dr. Alicia Nobles, the main author of the study suggests for example. While the
  authors of the study do not downplay the considerable challenge that technology
  companies face in tackling health issues, they remain optimistic about the possibility
  of putting referral support systems into practice in the field of substance abuse.
  "Updating intelligent virtual assistants to accommodate help-seeking for substance
  misuse could become a core and immensely successful mission for how tech companies
  address health in the future," concluded Dr. Nobles.
