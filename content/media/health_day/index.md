summary: 'Now there''s evidence that the #MeToo movement sparked more than mere conversation
  about sexual abuse in the United States. Searches related to reporting sexual assault
  and preventive training on sexual harassment were 30 percent higher during that
  same period, researchers found. "Eight months since the initiation of #MeToo, millions
  more than expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. "Since then,
  over 3,800 people have reached out to us seeking assistance for workplace sexual
  harassment," Tejani said. Koenen found the searches related to reporting or preventing
  sexual harassment to be most promising.'
