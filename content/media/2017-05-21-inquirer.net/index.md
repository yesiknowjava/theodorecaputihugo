  awareness campaign World AIDS Day, which has been held every December 1 since 1988.
  San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health research professor John
  W. Ayers headed the research that analyzed Google search data, which found that
  there were millions of searches on HIV prevention and testing after Sheen discussed
  his illness. Notable was that there was no call on HIV awareness at that time from
  either Sheen or public health leaders. The study was published in JAMA Internal
  Medicine. Ayers and his team then analyzed search queries and sales of home-testing
  kit OraQuick within the United States. They found that there was a correlation between
  the online searches on HIV and testing to the number of home-testing kits purchased.
  OraQuick is an oral swab test and is the "only rapid in-home HIV test kit available
  in the United States," according to EurekAlert. The findings of the follow-up study
  on testing were published in Prevention Science. OraQuick sales almost doubled following
  Sheens public admission and "8,225 more sales than expected" was recorded in the
  three weeks after. The research could impact how public health leaders could use
  data such as online searches, and also how they could influence peoples mindsets
  and behavior towards chronic illnesses such as HIV. Ayers said that their studies
  show public health leaders can use "big media data" to become "more responsive to
  the public it serves" instead of waiting for "traditional data" and only taking
  action after it. Co-author Jon-Patrick Allem also concluded that their "findings
  build on earlier studies that suggest empathy is easier to motivate others when
  the empathy is targeted toward an individual versus a group. It is easy to imagine
  that a single individual, like Sheen, disclosing his HIV status may be more compelling
  and motivating for people than an unnamed mass of individuals or a lecture from
  public health leaders." Nina V. Guno/JB RELATED STORIES: Charlie Sheens HIV diagnosis
