summary: According to our Google searches, Americans are more interested in CBD than
  any other health product or topic, a new study reveals. 'Three years ago, there
  was essentially no one searching about CBD online, but now there are an estimated
  6.4 million unique searches each month.' THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THC AND CBD Tetrahydrocannabinol
  (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are both derived from the cannabis plant. For every
  two internet searches for dieting in the United States we found there is one for
  CBD!' CBD searches surpassed vaccination searchers by 63 percent, exercise by nearly
  60 percent, veganism by 12 percent, and even its own parent plant, marijuana, by
  13 percent.
