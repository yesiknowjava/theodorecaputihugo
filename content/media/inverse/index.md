summary: A new study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine Thursday
  found that millions of Americans are searching for and finding pot from online retailers.
  Furthermore, the biggest finding of the study shows that online "marijuana buying"
  searches have practically tripled between 2005 to 2017 in the U.S., reaching a peak
  of between 1.4 and 2.4 million searches each month. This graphic shows the rise
  in online marijuana buying searches over the past 12 years. As the studys title
  notes, easy access to marijuana e-commerce poses public health concerns, especially
  when it comes to minors buying the substance without proper regulation. Online sales
  of marijuana are also illegal federally, even as states set their own marijuana
  regulations that legalize the drug in some places.
