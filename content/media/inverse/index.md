article: 'Now more than ever, American pot users are purchasing their supplies through
  online resources. A new study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine
  Thursday found that millions of Americans are searching for and finding pot from
  online retailers. A team of researchers, led by San Diego State University Graduate
  School of Public Health associate research professor John W. Ayers, reached this
  conclusion by going back and monitoring over 12 years of Google searches regarding
  buying marijuana -- from January 2005 and June 2017. Searches included many terms
  for cannabis; including marijuana, weed, and pot, which the researchers combined
  with the terms like buy, shop, or order. Furthermore, the biggest finding of the
  study shows that online "marijuana buying" searches have practically tripled between
  2005 to 2017 in the U.S., reaching a peak of between 1.4 and 2.4 million searches
  each month. This graphic shows the rise in online marijuana buying searches over
  the past 12 years. *American Journal of Preventive Medicine* "By studying anonymized,
  aggregate internet searches and search results, we were able to directly observe
  the online marijuana marketplace," the studys co-author Mark Dredze, of Johns Hopkins
  University, states in the paper, titled Online Sales of Marijuana: An Unrecognized
  Public Health Dilemma. As the studys title notes, easy access to marijuana e-commerce
  poses public health concerns, especially when it comes to minors buying the substance
  without proper regulation. Online sales of marijuana are also illegal federally,
  even as states set their own marijuana regulations that legalize the drug in some
  places. "States that have legalized marijuana might not be able to collect taxes
  to offset the public health costs of legal marijuana from online retailers," the
  studys lead author, Theodore Caputi, says. "And the instant online availability
  of marijuana could increase marijuana dependence among all age groups." This concern,
  the paper says, should help push for better policies between internet service providers
  and the government to help rid the web of these online pot shops. A new policy to
  address this issue would "effectively close off illicit retailers from consumers,"
  author Ayers said of the studys findings.'
