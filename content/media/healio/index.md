summary: 'SaveSexual minority adolescents more likely to consider, plan, attempt suicideSource/Disclosures
  Source: Caputi TL, et al. The investigators used the answers to compare these suicide
  risk behaviors between sexual minority teenagers and heterosexuals. In the past
  year, 40% of sexual minority adolescents reported seriously considering suicide
  (95% CI, 36.4-42.9); 34.9% reported planning suicide, (95% CI, 31.1- 38.6); and
  24.9% reported attempting suicide (95% CI, 21.5- 28.2) compared with 14.8% (95%
  CI, 13.7-15.9) of heterosexuals considering; 11.9% (95% CI, 10.7-13) planning; and
  6.3% (95% CI, 5.5-7.2) attempting suicide. Compared with heterosexuals, sexual minority
  teenagers were significantly more likely to consider (RR = 2.45; 95% CI, 2.12-2.81),
  plan (RR = 2.59; 95% CI, 2.18-3.04) and attempt (RR = 3.37; 95% CI, 2.73-4.09) suicide,
  after adjusting for confounders. Bisexual adolescents were 46% more likely to consider,
  40.8% more likely to plan or 31.9% more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual
  adolescents.'
