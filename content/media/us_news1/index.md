summary: By Robert Preidt, HealthDay Reporter(HealthDay)THURSDAY, March 22, 2018 (HealthDay
  News) -- Millions of Americans buy marijuana online illegally, a new study found.
  Marijuana shopping searches were highest in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington
  state, where recreational marijuana use is legal. That suggests online shopping
  for the drug is increasing nationwide, the researchers said. Immediate action is
  needed to halt online marijuana sales, according to study co-author Theodore Caputi,
  from the University College Cork in Ireland. "Children could obtain marijuana online
  without safeguards to protect them," Caputi said in a San Diego State news release.
