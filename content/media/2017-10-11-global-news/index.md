  will be and researchers at San Diego State University predict it will overtake the
  e-cigarette boom. Its a new method of consuming tobacco that claims to reduce or
  eliminate many of the harmful compounds that are produced with e-cigarettes, as
  well as combustible products like cigarettes, and its gaining popularity and "poised
  for explosive growth," researchers say. READ MORE: Young Canadians know theyre being

  product the answer to reduce smoking in Canada? - Sep 17, 2017 According to the
  study, heat-not-burn queries in Japan spiked by 1,426 per cent the first year it
  was on the market in 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, the number of queries grew by
  2,956 per cent. Based on the observed trends, researchers now project that heat-not-burn
  queries will continue to grow at a similar rate through 2018. "Heat-not-burn products
  have quickly become insanely popular," study co-author Mark Dredze said in a statement.
  "Two years ago, there were essentially no queries in Japan for heat-not-burn tobacco,
  but now there are between 5.9 and 7.5 million each month." Researchers also found
  that the interest in heat-not-burn products is surpassing the interest in e-cigarettes
  in Japan, which could mean sales of the new product will surpass e-cigarettes. But
  what about in Canada? Heat-not-burn products exist in Canada now, but the popularity
  is just beginning to grow, says Dr. Matthew Stanbrook, a specialist in respirology
  at Toronto Western Hospital. Story continues below advertisement "Its in the midst
  of gaining popularity but its still fairly low-key," he says. "I think its popularity
  is dwarfed by e-cigarettes at the moment, which has become the trendier thing to
  switch to if youre going to use an alternative nicotine delivery system, but it
  is growing and its got big, well-financed tobacco companies behind it." LISTEN:

  dont be fooled by the claims companies are making about the product as they are
  misleading, Stanbrook says. It leads the consumer to think that what they are consuming
  is safe, Stanbrook adds, when objectively it is not a safe product as it still delivers
  a lot of toxins. "This is a very concerning product," he says. "This is really nothing
  more than a marketing effort on behalf of the tobacco industry to keep people using
  tobacco products to expand the smoking population and getting people to stay on
  these products that might otherwise quit." The benefit of this type of smoking is
  that the smoker gets the nicotine from it, as well as less of the other toxic and
  carcinogenic products, Stanbrook says. "Note that I say ''less because it certainly
  does not eliminate all the products," he says. "In fact, independent research shows
  that theres still substantial amounts of some carcinogenic toxins that do come in
  this product." To what extent those levels of harmful toxin can impact ones health
  still needs to be explored in research, Stanbrook admits, but it will take some
  time as it is still a new product on the market. "No one needs this product," Stanbrook
  says. "There are many alternatives smokers have to help them quit smoking that have
  much more behind them in terms of evidence and data on safety than this new product
  does." Story continues below advertisement'
