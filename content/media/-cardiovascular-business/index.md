article: A smoking trend thats taken over Japan could soon be making its debut in
  the American market, possibly eclipsing e-cigarettes as a "more authentic" alternative
  to traditional tobacco products. Heat-not-burn cigarettes are battery-powered devices
  that take tobacco to the brink of combustion by heating tobacco leaves to around
  500 degrees and producing an inhalable aerosol, researcher Theodore L. Caputi and
  colleagues wrote in a recent PLOS One-published study. The smoking alternative has
  exploded in Japan, where average monthly searches for heat-not-burn tobacco products
  rose 1,426 percent between 2015 and 2016, but clinicians are largely unaware of
  its cardiovascular risks. "We do not know the health implications of heat-not-burn
  tobacco," Caputi said in an email. "While they are likely to be marketed--formally
  or informally--as 'healthier than cigarettes, there is insufficient evidence to
  make that claim. In itself, insufficient evidence is dangerous--tobacco companies
  have proven they wont wait until all the facts are in before they begin making health
  claims, and public health researchers need to fill in knowledge gaps quickly so
  that consumers can make well-informed decisions." Because of the public health implications
  of tobacco use, Caputi said, including the fact that nearly half of all smokers
  are estimated to die from a smoking-related illness, "this is not a decision that
  consumers should take lightly." In his study, Caputi and four colleagues used Google
  search query data to analyze the rising popularity of heat-not-burn products. Because
  traditional surveys about smoking dont ask about heat-not-burn tobacco, and since
  the product has little visibility in U.S. markets, the researchers focused on search
  engine analysis to evaluate the scale and growth potential of the new trend. In
  Japan, they found, there are now between 5.9 and 7.5 million estimated heat-not-burn-related
  Google searches per month, based on estimates from September. After initial heat-not-burn
  products hit the Japanese market in 2015, spurring a nearly 1,500 percent peak in
  Google searches on the topic, related searches grew by an additional 100 percent
  during the next year. Caputi and colleagues compared search queries for heat-not-burn
  products in Japan to Google searches for e-cigarettes in the U.S., since e-cigarettes
  arent legal in Japan. Heat-not-burn searches occurred more frequently in Japan than
  e-cigarette searches did in the U.S., the authors reported, with the first queries
  for heat-not-burn cigarettes eclipsing e-cigarettes in April 2016. The popularity
  of e-cigarettes in the U.S. is waning, Caputi said in a September 2016 article published
  in the medical journal Tobacco Control. Whereas growth of the e-cig industry was
  predicted to rise 126 percent in 2016, new Euromonitor International statistics
  estimate the reality to be closer to 51 percent. E-cigarette users are becoming
  displeased with the taste of the product, he said, citing Wells Fargo tobacco analyst
  Bonnie Herzog. While consumers arent necessarily concerned with the health risks
  of the product, they notice a lag in gratification from e-cigarettes that isnt true
  for traditional cigarettes, which deliver nicotine to the bloodstream much more
  quickly. E-cigarettes also lack a "throat hit," Caputi wrote, which many conventional
  tobacco users enjoy. Heat-not-burn products offer those feelings that e-cigarettes
  lack. "The pervasiveness of e-cigarettes and spreading discontentment with the lack
  of a throat-hit may open the floodgate for heat-not-burns success," he wrote. Heat-not-burn
  cigarettes have been gradually introduced to an international market in more than
  20 nations, including the United Kingdom, Russia, Korea, Switzerland and Italy,
  but the focal test market is Japan, Caputi and colleagues wrote in the PLOS One
  study. Japan Tobacco introduced its local heat-not-burn device, called Ploom TECH,
  in March 2016, and Philip Morris Internationals "IQOS" ("I Quit Ordinary Smoking")
  and British American Tobaccos "Glo" followed soon after. Now, PMI has entered the
  FDA approval process to start marketing and sales in the U.S. According to the Tobacco
  Control article, a Wells Fargo analyst predicted heat-not-burn products could displace
  up to 30 percent of the countrys combustible cigarette industry by 2025. Caputi
  wrote recent research has suggested heat-not-burn products are less harmful than
  combustible cigarettes, but other studies have shown risks of smoking heat-not-burn
  tobacco include carbon monoxide and formaldehyde exposure, as well as the potential
  for side-stream emissions. Reto Auer, MD, MAS, and colleagues found that PMIs IQOS
  releases smoke containing elements from pyrolysis and thermogenic degradation that
  mirror the components of traditional cigarette smoke. "PMI claims that IQOS releases
  no smoke because the tobacco does not combust and the tobacco leaves are only heated,
  not burned," Auer and co-authors wrote in a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine.
  "However, there can be smoke without fire. Dancing around the definition of smoke
  to avoid indoor smoking bans is unethical." Now, Caputi said, is the time to act.
  In his PLOS One paper, he and co-authors wrote their findings were a "clarion call"
  for public health practitioners, who should expand heat-not-burn product surveillance,
  preemptively study the smoking alternatives risks and benefits and adjust health
  messaging about tobacco products. He said that despite the presence of the product
  overseas, clinicians in the U.S. are largely unaware of the trend and its implications.
  "Unfortunately, we have insufficient evidence to make claims regarding the long-term
  health effects of either e-cigarettes or heat-not-burn devices, and so making comparisons
  at this point is very difficult," Caputi told Cardiovascular Business. "However,
  we know that e-cigarettes are perceived as less harmful than traditional cigarettes,
  and we imagine heat-not-burn products will be marketed to cultivate that same perception.
  While its too early to tell if heat-not-burn products will overtake e-cigarettes
  as the new method of smoking, the available evidence suggests heat-not-burn products
  are poised for explosive growth as they are introduced into new markets."
