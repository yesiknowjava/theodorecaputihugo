summary: 'Americans are getting creative in finding ways to gain access to marijuana
  online, even if they arent legally allowed to do so, a recent study found. For one,
  buying and selling cannabis on the internet is illegal because it is a largely uncontrolled

  typed in by those buying marijuana online and found that the highest numbers came
  from Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, with search volumes rising between
  1.4 million and 2.4 million every month from 2005 to 2017. The research monitored
  search terms such as "cannabis," "weed," "marijuana" and "pot," combined with action
  words like "order," "shop," "buy" and more. Recreational marijuana for users over
  the age of 21 is currently legal in 10 U.S. states.'
