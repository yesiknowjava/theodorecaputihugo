  Photo by Atomazul/ShutterstockApril 19 (UPI) -- People who use medical marijuana
  have higher rates of medical and non-medical prescription drug use -- including
  pain relievers -- than others, according to a new study. About 1.4 percent of all
  respondents, 776 people, said they used medical marijuana. Survey participants who
  use medical marijuana were 60 percent more likely to report prescription drug use,
  for medical reasons or not, than those who did not use medical marijuana, researchers
  report. They noted that chronic pain is the most common reason for medical marijuana
  use, and people in other studies who use medical marijuana consistently report substituting
  cannabis for other drugs.
