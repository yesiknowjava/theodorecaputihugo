article: 'Keith Houston, in his 2014 book Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation,
  Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks, narrates how the story of the hashtag starts
  in the 14th century with the Latin term Libra Pondo, meaning "pound in weight".
  This was abbreviated to lb and drawn with a bar across the top of both letters,
  to indicate that the I and b were connected. "As people wrote this faster and faster,
  it evolved into the hash symbol," Houston explains. In the late 17th century, Newton
  was using the "lb" contraction generously, and Houston offers photographic evidence
  of an elegant scrawl by Newton to illustrate when it started resembling what we
  now call the hashtag. This versatile symbol--used to indicate everything from weight,
  numbers, a sharp musical note, and spaces between words by copy editors--found renewed
  purpose on the internet a decade ago. When open-source advocate Chris Messina first
  proposed vertical groupings of messages and trends on Twitter by means of the hashtag
  in 2007 (he wanted a sign that could be input from a low-tech mobile phone) it was
  dismissed as something for nerds. Today this tagging system is the soul food of
  Twitter and other social media platforms. In the last half-a-decade, apart from
  facilitating several successful corporate campaigns--#ShareACoke, #LikeAGirl, #TouchThePickle--the
  hashtag has become a globally recognized symbol of social crusades. But even at
  a time hashtag campaigns are ubiquitous, the reach, recall and socio-political ramifications
  of #MeToo have been unprecedented, at least in urban India. It is #OccupyWallStreet
  and #IceBucketChallenge rolled into one. While we cant say for sure if it would
  have been as successful had it been called, say, #WomenSpeakOut or #CallingOutPatriarchy,
  we do know #MeToos driving force has been its crisp coinage that evokes a sense
  of community and collective empathy. To rewind from the #MeToo juggernaut of 2018:
  The MeToo movement was founded by American civil rights activist Tarana Burke in
  2006. In 2017, the hashtag went viral--and reached the rest of the world--after
  actor Alyssa Milano posted a tweet encouraging others to say "Me Too". Its worth
  noting that #MeToo became viral after a celebrity chipped in--and accepting that
  this is the nature of most contemporary campaigns. Subsequently, its high points
  have been marked by the role of champions of all kinds. #MeToo scaled up in India
  after 25 September 2018, when Bollywood actor Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar
  of sexually harassing her on the sets of a movie 10 years ago. A few days later,
  comedian Mahima Kukreja shared her #MeToo story on Twitter, alleging fellow comedian
  Utsav Chakraborty had sent her unsolicited photos of his penis. Things gathered
  momentum when the very next day, Sandhya Menon, a freelance journalist based in
  Bengaluru, shared accounts of incidents of sexual harassment by editors at newspapers
  she had worked in--former DNA and The Times of India (TOI) editor-in-chief Gautam
  Adhikari and K.R. Sreenivas, resident editor (Hyderabad) of TOI. While Adhikari
  quit the think tank Centre for American Progress, Sreenivas too resigned after Menon
  and six other women sent a petition to Bennett Coleman and Co. Ltd, the owner of
  The Times of India. Kukreja and Menons accounts encouraged more women to share their
  stories across entertainment, journalism, art, law, education and advertising. An
  inflection point, one that propelled #MeToo out of social media to Page 1 and primetime,
  was when Lounge columnist Priya Ramani (disclosure: she is my former editor), posted
  that tweet. On 8 October, after another day of women sharing their #MeToo stories
  on Twitter, she posted a story shed written for Vogue.in a year earlier, when the
  Harvey Weinstein scandal had broken. "I began this piece with my MJ Akbar story.
  Never named him because he didnt ''do anything. Lots of women have worse stories
  about this predator--maybe theyll share." It ended with: "Well get you all one day."
  A few days later, The Wire published journalist Ghazala Wahabs on-record account
  of sexual harassment by Akbar, a celebrated former journalist and editor. Five days
  after Wahabs account, and nine days after Ramanis tweet, Akbar resigned from his
  post as minister of state for external affairs. In a statement he said "...a sea
  of innuendo, speculation and abusive diatribe has been built around something that
  never happened". Akbars criminal defamation case against Ramani was another inflection
  point. With the matter sub judice, when Ramani couldnt file her column for the 20
  October issue of Lounge, we responded by running #IamWithPriya in place of her weekly
  column. I believe that more than the four words, it was the punctuation that was
  the statement. Newtons scrawl now stood for the weight of a collective. One of the
  arguments against this three-month #MeToo wave has been that Dalit and Bahujan voices
  havent been adequately represented in what has largely been an urban, elite movement.
  It was Raya Sarkar, then a 24-year-old law student at the University of California,
  who kick-started the Indian arm of #MeToo last year when she published a list of
  alleged sexual predators in academia. Her LoSHA (List of Sexual Harassers in Academia)
  effort was radical. Sarkar, who identifies as Bahujan, said in an interview to Mint
  in October that she doesnt mind how the movement is framed as long as it acknowledges
  her labour. She stressed its place in a continuum. "I would like to credit Bhanvari
  Devi for igniting the #MeToo movement years ago," she said on email, referring to
  the the case surrounding a Rajasthani social workers gang-rape by five upper caste
  men in 1992 for trying to stop a child marriage. "Because of her we have the legal
  recourses to sexual harassment we have today. Due process failed her and she awaits
  justice even today." As #MeToo slowly loses its primetime spot in public consciousness,
  an important thing to remember is that it is an umbrella term. Countless editorials
  have tried to lay this out through the year and, yet, every so often, I hear grouses
  from men about "distinguishing the nature of the offence" and "the ease of anonymity".
  And the throwaway statement that they now feel "afraid" to talk to women. Do feel
  afraid. #MeToo is an invisible spectre, present even when it is not. In fact, when
  Ramani posted that tweet, she did not use #MeToo but instead she ended it with #ulti
  (vomit). Some might say its the same. #MeToo is an umbrella that goes from a seemingly
  innocuous, "Youre very dressed up today" to pinning a colleague against a hotel
  room wall against her will. The laissez-faire nature of the movement has given it
  both volume and opened it up for scepticism. Anonymous allegations cut both ways.
  For the survivors, it allows a forum to share stories without fear of renewed trauma
  or social and professional repercussions. For the accused and their defendants,
  it makes it easier to dismiss the allegations. Last week, Indias most-valued contemporary
  artist Subodh Gupta categorically denied a series of anonymous allegations against
  him posted by the Instagram account Scene and Herd. In response to an anonymous
  allegation against him, photographer Pablo Bartholomew said in a statement, "With
  no other context, timeline and explanation beyond the account of the anonymous persons
  story, it makes it quite worrisome that anyone can name and be anonymous, with lack
  of answerability or fact. With no facts presented, I am at loss to address or respond
  to the stated accusation..." In an email to me, Bartholomew has complained about
  "the unfair example of juxtaposing the anonymous allegations against me (not sexual
  in nature) with those who have been accused of severe sexual harassment". Bartholomew
  is on fair ground, except that #MeToo is about breaking the ground. Anonymity is
  a valid recourse for feminist or marginal movements worldwide (what is political
  graffiti, after all?). The American feminist collective for women artists, Guerrilla
  Girls, wear gorilla masks to retain their anonymity and "to keep the focus on the
  issue and away from our personalities". Last week, at a lecture performance at the
  Kochi-Muziris Biennale, Indias largest art event, their video work titled The Guerrilla
  Girls Guide to Behaving Badly told women to "be a creative complainer" and "be a
  professional complainer". It also advised them to "be anonymous". There has been
  collateral damage to women too. Director Shazia Iqbals film Bebaak was dropped by
  the Mumbai Film Festival because Anurag Kashyap was one of its producers. "As a
  survivor of child abuse, several sexual assaults and harassment at workplace, I
  find it really odd, discomforting, unfair and traumatizing to be at the receiving
  end of the most powerful feminist moment of our times," she wrote. "Sorry [festival]
  board members, you missed standing by the #MeToo movement by a mile." Its useful
  to look at the MeToo movement in terms of economist Joseph Schumpeters idea of "creative
  destruction". He describes it as a process that "incessantly revolutionizes the
  economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly
  creating a new one". #MeToo is a crisis of gender--an inevitable outcome of years
  of building patriarchal capital. It was bound to be gloriously destructive. Some
  long-term changes have been put in motion. But only applauding the formal developments
  discredits the movement. There is bad news, sure. Many of the men called out are
  slowly being rehabilitated without disclosures on how internal investigations were
  carried out and what was revealed. Netflix, for instance, said it would stick with
  the team behind the show Sacred Games for a second season after an independent investigation
  into allegations of sexual harassment against individuals involved with the show.
  Riyas Komu, a co-founder of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, who has a series of anonymous
  allegations against him, was seen near the art event earlier this month. He was
  fondly remembered and "missed" in the formal opening address, prompting a spontaneous
  mini-movement at the festival. But these are not failures of the #MeToo movement.
  These are failures of systems of addressal and correction--the institutional, the
  corporate, the legal and so on that are expected to rise to action now. The true
  success of #MeToo is that womens stories have moved from the personal to the powerful
  to the political. Its greatest achievement isnt the men who lost their jobs or even
  their public shaming or the men and women who have been revealed as closet misogynists,
  but the fundamental shift in what isnt acceptable. Its true success is that women
  have the language to speak out. While not many women might raise their hands in
  a room if asked "Have you been sexually assaulted?" they can now raise their hands
  when asked "Do you have a #MeToo story to share?" The MeToo hashtag has given women
  a vocabulary that acts as an arsenal. The hashtag is a versatile weapon. In chess,
  it represents a move that results in a checkmate. Subscribe to Mint Newsletters
