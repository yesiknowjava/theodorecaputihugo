summary: 'And since actress Alyssa Milano drew attention to the #MeToo movement --
  begun more than a decade earlier by the activist Tarana Burke -- with a tweet in
  October 2017, Americans have been thinking quite a lot about sexual harassment and
  sexual assault. pic.twitter.com/k2oeCiUf9n -- Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October
  15, 2017It now appears that Milanos exhortation sent Americans to Google in droves
  to learn more about what exactly qualified as sexual harassment and sexual assault
  -- and what they could do about it. Sure enough, online interest in sexual harassment
  and assault spiked in the U.S., the researchers found. "The post-#MeToo period corresponded
  with the greatest number of sexual harassment and/or assault searches ever recorded
  in the United States," the researchers reported Friday in the journal JAMA Internal
  Medicine. The researchers also documented a 30% increase in searches about reporting
  instances of sexual harassment or sexual assault, along with a 51% increase in searches
  about training to prevent harassment and assault in the first place.'
