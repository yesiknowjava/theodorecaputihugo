summary: (Reuters Health) - - Lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) teens
  are more than three times as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers,
  a U.S. study suggests. To assess suicide risk, participants were asked how many
  times in the past year they had seriously considered suicide, planned a suicide
  attempt or tried to kill themselves. By contrast, 15 percent of heterosexual adolescents
  said they had considered suicide and 12 percent said they had planned a suicide
  attempt. The increased suicide risk for sexual minority teens held true when researchers
  looked at females and males separately. Gay teens were more than four times as likely
  to attempt suicide as heterosexual males, while bisexuals had more than five times
  the risk.
