summary: WEDNESDAY, Oct. 11, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A smoking mechanism that mixes
  the electronics behind e-cigarettes with the tobacco-burning properties of traditional
  cigarettes is sparking public health worries as it takes direct aim at the American
  market. Unlike e-cigarettes, the so called "heat-not-burn" device works by warming
  up tobacco to about 500 degrees Fahrenheit, producing an inhalable aerosol. By contrast,
  e-cigarettes function by heating a nicotine-infused liquid, minus the dangerous
  smoke that is emitted by tobacco-burning traditional cigarettes. The heat-not-burn
  innovation has not been approved for sale in the United States, but an application
  for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval was filed late last year. A new study,
  though, cautions that in countries where the product is already on the market, like
  Japan, it has achieved rapid popularity as a smoke-free option for those e-smokers
  who yearn for the old taste and back-of-throat burning sensation (or "hit") of traditional
  cigarettes.
