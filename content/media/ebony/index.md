article: 'In 2006, activist Tarana Burke founded Just Be Inc., a nonprofit that offers
  services to victims of sexual harassment and abuse. She called the movement she
  created "Me Too." The name was birthed in 1997 after Burke listened to the sexual
  abuse victim story of a 13-year-old girl. "I didnt have a response or a way to help
  her in that moment, and I couldnt even say ''me too, Burke told The New York Times.
  Over a year ago, the New Yorker and The Times shared stories about now-disgraced
  Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein and his decades of alleged sexual misconduct.
  The pieces gained much traction and the #MeToo movement ballooned on social media
  after actress Alyssa Milano tweeted the phrase. https://www.instagram.com/p/BqsVhjAAKA-/

  15, 2017 Women and men shared their experiences of sexual abuse and harassment.
  It forced a conversation about the misuse of power and its intersection with sexual
  abuse. In the nearly two years since the Weinstein scandal, the #MeToo movement
  has sparked changes in almost every industry. Powerful men including CEOS, political
  candidates and public figures were expelled from their positions because of growing
  numbers of allegations. In 2017, TIME magazine named the "silence breakers" of the
  movement as the coveted Person of the Year. As the movement continues to shape power
  dynamics and address once-normalized mistreatment of women (and men), EBONY.com
  looks back on powerful moments #MeToo had during the past 12 months. Times Up After
  a slew of sexual misconduct scandals in 2017, some women in Hollywood took action.
  On Jan. 1, 2018, 300 prominent women in the film, theater and TV industry signed
  a full-page letter in The New York Times and the Spanish language newspaper La Opinion
  to exhibit solidarity for working-class women who experienced sexual assault. According
  to the initiatives website, the Times Up movement is a "unified call for change
  from women in entertainment for women everywhere. From movie sets to farm fields
  to boardrooms alike, we envision nationwide leadership that reflects the world in
  which we live." Through the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, money is raised to help
  support less-privileged victims of sexual assault and harassment cases with their
  legal fees #MuteRKelly Despite more than 20 years of sex assault allegations against
  R. Kelly, his career had remained mostly unaffected until this year. The singer
  had tour dates in Chicago and New York City canceled as a result of a July 2017
  article that accused Kelly of running a "sex cult." On April 30, the Women of Color
  committee of the Times Up organization announced that it would be joining the #MuteRKelly
  campaign, which was created by Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye last year in
  response to the continued sexual assault allegations against the singer. These accusations
  seem have had little to no effect on R. Kellys career. As with the current onslaught
  of sexual misconduct allegations against prominent men in the entertainment industry,
  the campaign calls for RCA Records and other companies to stop working with the
  51-year-old artist. "Today we join an existing online campaign called #MuteRKelly,"
  states the letter from the committee posted exclusively on The Root. "Over the past
  25 years, the man known publicly as R. Kelly has sold 60 million albums, toured
  the globe repeatedly and accumulated hundreds of millions of plays on radio and
  streaming services." The campaign would like to see Apple Music, Spotify and Ticketmaster
  stop promoting Kellys music and concerts. The campaign also called for an investigation
  of Kelly. Spotify removed the singers music from its promoted playlists in May,
  but it was ultimately returned after backlash about censorship. Surviving R. Kelly,
  a six-hour docuseries exploring the abuse claims made against the R&B singer, will
  air on Lifetime in three parts on Jan. 3-5 at 9 p.m. ET. Terry Crews Testifies Survivors
  Bill of Rights https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hldAnf6EEeA Terry Crews delivered
  a powerful testimony on June 26 at Capitol Hill condemning "toxic masculinity" and
  its effects on sexual assault. The actor explained the "critical" need for the proposed
  Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights, which was drafted by sexual assault survivor
  Amanda Nguyen, and establishes consistent rules and procedures for prosecuting sexual
  assault crimes. "I am an actor, author, former athlete, advocate and a survivor
  of a sexual assault," Crews said in his opening statement. He talked about his accusing
  Adam Venit, a talent agent with William Morris Endeavor (WME), of groping him at
  a party in 2016. Crews testimony and continued work on being a voice has helped
  other men get over the stigma that only weak or gay men can be victims of sexual
  assault. 141 Sexual Abuse Survivors Accept Courage Award at ESPYS Six-time Olympic
  winning gymnast Aly Raisman and dozens of other survivors of disgraced USA Gymnastics
  and Michigan State team doctor Larry Nassar accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award
  on July 18 at the 2018 ESPYS. In a powerful display of solidarity, the women who
  call themselves "sister survivors" presented the message, "We may suffer alone,
  but we survive together." The award is given annually to athletes who embody the
  spirit and tenacity of late tennis legend and human rights activist Arthur Ashe.
  Nassar is serving 40 to 175 years in prison for sexually abusing more than 150 women
  and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment over the past 20 years.
  Bill Cosby Sentencing In September, Bill Cosby, 81, was sentenced to three to 10
  years in prison for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004 at
  his Pennsylvania home. His is the first celebrity conviction of the #MeToo movement.
  Like with many other celebrities accused of sexual misconduct and assault, rumors
  and speculation about Cosbys behavior circulated for years. In 2014, comedian Hannibal
  Burress made a joke about the Ghost Dad stars alleged actions, which caused the
  public to reevaluate the fallen comics mistreatment of women. Although many of the
  allegations brought against Cosby date to before the Me Too movement, the current
  climate of the changing industry allowed his accusers the space to call him out.'
