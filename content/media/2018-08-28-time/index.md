article: The death by suicide of a 9-year-old Colorado fourth grader underscores the
  challenges surrounding youth mental health -- particularly the risks LGBTQ kids
  face. Jamel Myles was found dead of suicide just days after his mom said he came
  out as gay to his classmates, the Denver Post reports. Myles, who had come out to
  his family over the summer, reportedly faced significant bullying from his classmates
  as he began the new school year. "My child died because of bullying. My baby killed
  himself," Myles mother, Leia Pierce, told the Post. "He didnt deserve this." While
  its difficult to assign a single cause to any death by suicide, Myles joins a tragic
  number of children who have faced bullying before taking their own lives. And kids
  of minority sexual orientations are at elevated risk. An estimated 34% of gay, lesbian
  or bisexual kids face bullying at school, which may make them especially susceptible
  to suicidal behavior, says John Ackerman, a clinical psychologist and the suicide
  prevention coordinator for the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide
  Childrens Hospital. "When youre at a really young age, you take a lot of your cues
  from the environment," Ackerman says. "When you have something very relevant to
  the way a person views themselves, like sexual or gender identity, that may cause
  a reaction like bullying or cyberbullying, that can affect a persons well-being."
  When children are bullied for who they are, they can feel "like they cant control
  their world, and other people will not respond to them in a positive way. Being
  younger, they dont know that that will change." Research confirms that LGBTQ youth
  are at a disproportionately high risk of suicide -- which is particularly concerning
  given that suicide rates and attempts are on the rise among kids in general. A JAMA
  research letter based on 2015 CDC data found that about 40% of gay, lesbian, bisexual
  or questioning high school students reported seriously considering suicide during
  the prior year, compared to almost 15% of heterosexual adolescents. Almost a quarter
  of LGBQ students said they attempted suicide during that time, compared to about
  6% of heterosexual teens, the report says. And while the CDCs data didnt include
  transgender youth, research has shown that, among the 40% of transgender adults
  who report attempting suicide, 92% said they had made an attempt before the age
  of 25. John Ayers, one of the authors of the JAMA paper and a computational epidemiologist
  at San Diego State University, says its not possible to say for sure whats responsible
  for these heightened risks, since "its difficult to point to a [singular] trigger"
  with any death by suicide. But, he says, lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer or questioning
  kids may face challenges that their peers dont. When people are suicidal "and then
  theyre exposed to a trigger, that final trigger can push them over the edge," Ayers
  says. For kids who arent heterosexual, "the stressors that they face may be pushing
  them over the edge and making them act on that more." LGBTQ individuals are also
  three times more likely than straight peers to experience a mental health condition
  such as depression or anxiety, according to the National Alliance on Mental Health,
  which may also increase a persons risk of suicide. Ayers adds that sexual minority
  individuals may also be more prone to substance abuse. Knowing and being proactive
  about these risk factors, both experts say, could make a real difference in suicide
  prevention. "A supportive environment can be a prevention tool," Ayers says. Ideally,
  that would mean cooperation among parents, educators and school districts when it
  comes to helping LGBTQ kids work through the obstacles they face. Ackerman says
  teachers should be aware of suicide warning signs and available resources, and schools
  and health care systems should work to make mental health care more accessible to
  young people. But, he says, suicide prevention starts at home -- which may mean
  asking your child tough questions and guiding them toward help if theyre struggling.
  "LGBT youth, like all youth, need love and attention and acceptance when things
  are difficult for them," Ackerman says. "We want the home to be a source where theres
  safety and security, and that promotes strong mental health and resilience." If
