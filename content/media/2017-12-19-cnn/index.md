article: '(CNN) LGBQ teens are more vulnerable to planning or attempting suicide,
  according to a research letter published Tuesday in the journal JAMA. Looking at
  answers in the 2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey in the US, researchers found
  that 40% of high school students who are considered sexual minorities -- who identify
  as gay, lesbian or bisexual or questioning, meaning they are unsure of their orientation
  -- were seriously considering suicide. Transgender teens were not included in the
  US government''s survey, but research has shown that transgender youth may face
  a similarly high, if not higher, suicide risk. The survey, conducted by the Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention , looked at a nationally representative sample
  of 15,624 students across the country in that were in grades 9 through 12 (typically14
  to 18 years old). Of the sexual minorities in the study, 34.9% were planning suicide
  and 24.9% had attempted suicide in the previous year. Compared with heterosexual
  teens, those numbers are exceptionally high: Of the straight teens in the study,
  14.8% had seriously considered suicide, 11.9% had been planning suicide, and 6.3%
  had made an attempt in the past year. The children who were bisexual faced the greatest
  suicide risk; 46% had considered suicide in the past year. Bisexual girls were the
  most vulnerable, with nearly 48% saying they had considered taking their own lives.
  Girls who identify as lesbian also had higher rates. More than 40% said they seriously
  considered suicide in the past year; in comparison, 19.6% of girls who considered
  themselves heterosexual said they had seriously considered suicide in the past year.
  Of boys who identify as gay, 25.5% had. Past research has noted the higher suicide
  risks for these groups, but much of that work comes from regional surveys , or teens
  who were surveyed were not from a general sample of the population. JUST WATCHED

  youth. "We want this to be a wake-up call and a call to action, so that this will
  become a part of the national agenda to address this very real public health crisis,"
  said research co-author John W. Ayers, a computational epidemiologis t who works
  as an adjunct associate professor at San Diego State University. He hopes the numbers
  will prompt a "comprehensive reaction" from policy-makers, clinicians and parents
  and teachers. "While this may be a small subset of our teens, this burden is tremendous."

  about young people in the US before we do something about this?" asked Cianciotto,

  that lesbian, gay and bisexual students had fewer suicidal thoughts and attempts
  when schools had gay-straight alliances and had long-term policies prohibiting expression
  of homophobia. Yet not all schools have these programs, although national groups
  like the Trevor Project offer 24/7 crisis lines to help young LGBTQ people. In a
  separate study on suicide issues concerning LGBTQ teens, also published Tuesday,
  researchers saw a heightened risk for suicide and found that these teens were more
  likely than their straight peers to have experienced some form of adverse childhood
  experience such as abuse. The authors of this study also say there is evidence that
  suicide rates are going up for this age group. "Too little is changing, and for
  too long, our society has put Band-Aids on this problem," Cianciotto said. "While
  Band-Aids are good, we need to help by better addressing the root causes of these
  problems."'

  (typically 14 to 18 years old).</p>

  <p>Of the sexual minorities in the study, 34.9% were planning suicide and 24.9%

  <p>Past research has noted the higher suicide risks for these groups, but much of
  that work comes from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26789401">regional

  <p>This research is one of the first nationally available estimates representing

  <p>&quot;We want this to be a wake-up call and a call to action, so that this will

  <p>He hopes the numbers will prompt a &quot;comprehensive reaction&quot; from policy-makers,

  <p>Jason Cianciotto, <a href="https://tylerclementi.org/cianciotto-executive-director/">executive
  director</a> of the <a href="https://tylerclementi.org/about/">Tyler Clementi Foundation</a>,
  agreed.</p>

  <p>&quot;The question is, how many times are we going to reveal the same horrific
  information about young people in the US before we do something about this?&quot;
  asked Cianciotto, who was not involved in the new study. The Clementi family created
  the anti-bullying foundation <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/09/30/spaulding.rutgers.suicide/index.html">after
  Tyler, who had been bullied for being gay, </a>died in 2010 having jumped off a
  bridge.</p>

  <p>When Cianciotto was co-authoring the book &quot;<a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/4656286/lgbt_youth_in_americas_schools">LGBT
  Youth in America''s Schools</a>,&quot; he came across similar startling suicide
  statistics that go back as <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J082v15n01_12">far
  as the late 1980s.</a></p>

  <p>What''s driving them, he said, is that not all teens live in a supportive culture,
  even with the advances in same-sex marriage, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23790196">inclusive
  anti-bullying programs</a> and non-discrimination protection. Many evangelical Christians,
  for instance, still preach that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2015/05/22/pkg-mother-of-gay-son-speaks-about-pastor.wnem.html">LGBTQ
  kids are going to hell</a>, he said.</p>

  <p>&quot;There are still too many LGBTQ young people growing up in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19117902">harmful
  environments</a> where they are rejected <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21161599">at
  home </a>or at church <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24328634">or
  schoo</a>l; they face <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21517860">pervasive
  bullying</a>; they lack access to <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pits.20173/full">safe
  or supportive spaces</a> and don''t have supportive physical or mental health care,
  and all those comorbidities pile up and increase the suicide risk,&quot; Cianciotto
  said.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26793284">Research has shown </a>that
  lesbian, gay and bisexual students had fewer suicidal thoughts and attempts when
  schools had gay-straight alliances and had long-term policies prohibiting expression

  Trevor Project </a>offer 24/7 crisis lines to help young LGBTQ people.</p>

  <p>In a separate study on suicide issues concerning LGBTQ teens, <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2017/images/12/19/sexual.identity.adverse.childhood.experiences.and.suicidal.behaviors.pdf">also
