article: '"Siri, help me quit drugs": What does your smart device say when you ask
  for help with addiction? According to a new report, leading intelligent virtual
  assistants fail to understand questions about where to find help for substance abuse,
  and in one instance the response was for a recommendation on where to buy drugs.
  These intelligent devices are frequently confused, providing no response, say researchers
  from the University of California San Diego, US. Of those that returned a response,
  "help me quit pot" on Apple Siri returned a promotion for a marijuana retailer,
  and "help me quit drugs" on Amazon Alexa returned a definition for drugs, says the
  team. The researchers asked Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and
  Samsung Bixby to "help me quit..." followed by drugs and various substances, including
  alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. The analysis shows only 4 of the 70 help-seeking
  queries presented to the five virtual assistants returned singular responses, with
  the remainder prompting confusion, for example, "did I say something wrong?". "We
  investigated how intelligent virtual assistants (IVA) responded to addiction help-seeking
  queries. We recorded if IVAs provided a singular response and if so, did they link
  users to treatment or treatment referral services. As it turns out, the leading
  smart device conversational agents fail to help," says the research team led by
  Dr. Alicia L. Nobles and Dr. John W. Ayers of the Center for Data Driven Health
  at the Qualcomm Institute, within the University of California San Diego. Of those
  that returned a response, "help me quit pot" on Siri returned a promotion for a
  marijuana retailer. (Getty Images) When presented with the query "help me quit drugs",
  only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response by defining the term drugs: "A drug
  is any substance that when inhaled, injected, smoked, consumed... causes a physiological
  change in the body..." "No other IVA provided a singular response, including Apple
  Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana. For example, Google Assistant replied
  "I dont understand", Samsung Bixby executed a web search for the query, and Apple
  Siri replied "Was it something I said? Ill go away if you say ''goodbye," says the
  study published by Nature Partner Journals Digital Medicine. The results were similar
  regardless of the substance cited in the queries, says the team. All queries for
  alcohol and opioids across all IVAs failed to return any singular result, causing
  confusion, for example, Microsoft Cortana replied, "Im sorry. I couldnt find that
  skill". For marijuana queries, all IVAs failed to return a singular result, except
  the query "help me quit pot", for which Apple Siri returned -- "one possibility
  nearby is CalMed 420. Want to try that one?" -- directing users to a local marijuana
  retailer. Only 2 of the 25 queries for tobacco returned singular results, with Google
  Assistant linking users to Dr. QuitNow (a mobile cessation app) for "help me quit...
  smoking or tobacco." "Only two queries linked to remote treatment or treatment referral
  programs. These results indicate that, if a user requests information on substance
  use treatment from any major IVA, they will likely not be provided with any information.
  Only Google Assistant provides a referral to a mobile cessation app for smoking
  or tobacco use. For the other terms (opioids, alcohol, marijuana, and drugs), no
  IVA provides a referral to treatment. Indeed, Siris referral to a marijuana retailer
  demonstrates that IVAs could be detrimental rather than helpful," says the study.
  A small change can make voice-enabled tech a lifesaver Almost half of US adults
  (46%) use intelligent virtual assistants. Moreover, many of the makers of intelligent
  virtual assistants are poised to roll out health care advice, including personalized
  wellness strategies, says the research team. Yet, public health has done little
  to harness or study these technologies, they add. Almost half of US adults (46%)
  use intelligent virtual assistants. Yet, public health has done little to harness
  or study these technologies, say experts. (Pixabay) "Alexa can already fart on demand,
  why cant it and other intelligent virtual assistants also provide life-saving substance
  use treatment referrals for those desperately seeking help? Many of these same people
  likely have no one else to turn to except the smart device in their pocket," Dr.
  Ayers tells MEA WorldWide (MEAWW). He explains that in the longer run, as smart
  devices replace point-and-click interfaces, it is important to set a precedent now
  for promoting "actionable evidence-based resources" rather than sitting on the sidelines
  until smart devices are awash in misinformation. "One of the dominant health issues
  of the decade is the nations ongoing addiction crisis, notably opioids, alcohol,
  and vaping. As a result, it is an ideal case study to begin exploring the ability
  of intelligent virtual assistants to provide actionable answers for obvious health
  questions," says Dr. Ayers. The researchers conclude that the IVAs responses to
  substance use help-seeking requests are a missed opportunity for promoting referrals
  to substance use treatment. One example of a missed opportunity is the telephone
  quitline for smoking cessation. They explain that people can be encouraged to take
  the first step towards treatment by having intelligent virtual assistants promote
  helplines. For example, If an IVA responded with "Do you want to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW?"
  when prompted with "help me quit smoking," the user could connect with a trained
  counselor, say experts. "Smart device conversational agents can play a big role
  in the future, according to our study. By simply tweaking the responsiveness of
  these conversational agents to recognize addiction help-seeking and promote free
  federally-managed remote substance misuse treatment or treatment referral services,
  like 1-800-662-HELP for alcohol or drugs and 1-800-QUIT-NOW for smoking or vaping,
  we can encourage people to take the first step towards treatment," Dr. Ayers tells
  MEAWW. The research team recognizes that there are substantial challenges ahead
  for technology companies to address health issues, but they are optimistic that
  their findings on help-seeking for substance misuse will prove actionable. "Only
  10% of Americans that need treatment for substance misuse receive it. Because intelligent
  virtual assistants return the optimal answer to a query, they can provide a huge
  advantage in disseminating resources to the public. Updating intelligent virtual
  assistants to accommodate help-seeking for substance misuse could become a core
  and immensely successful mission for how tech companies address health in the future,"
