summary: 'Moreover, after actress Alyssa Milano''s #MeToo tweet went viral in October
  2017, #MeToo has caused Google searches about sexual assault to shatter records
  and reach an all-time high. Last October, The New York Times broke the news that
  Weinstein had faced numerous sexual assault allegations over the years, and that
  he had paid off his accusers. Following the Weinstein scandal, researchers from
  Harvard Medical School and UC San Diego took a look at Google search rates for sexual
  harassment and sexual assault before and after Milano''s #MeToo tweet. Researchers
  also discovered a 51 percent increase in searches about preventive training for
  sexual harassment and assault, and a 30 percent increase in searches about reporting
  cases of sexual violence. Specifically, in the eight months after Milano''s #MeToo
  tweet, researchers found that there had been 40 to 54 million Google searches about
  understanding, preventing, and reporting sexual harassment and assault.'
