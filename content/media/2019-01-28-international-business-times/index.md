article: 'Americans are getting creative in finding ways to gain access to marijuana
  online, even if they arent legally allowed to do so, a recent study found. According
  to research published on the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, millions are
  looking for marijuana retailers on the internet, with the rate rising by almost
  300 percent from 2005 to 2017. While this number seems normal given that many U.S.
  states have already legalized the use of marijuana for various health and recreational
  purposes, its easy availability online sans any form of regulation poses a public
  health threat. For one, buying and selling cannabis on the internet is illegal because
  it is a largely uncontrolled market and its sellers do not follow a screening system
  with their buyers. In a news release on EurekAlert, research lead John W. Ayers,
  associate research professor from the San Diego State University Graduate School
  of Public Health, said that anybody, regardless of location and age, is able to
  purchase marijuana using their laptops and mobile devices. Photo: Getty Images/
  Don MacKinnon/AFP The proponents looked into typical Google searches typed in by
  those buying marijuana online and found that the highest numbers came from Colorado,
  Nevada, Oregon and Washington, with search volumes rising between 1.4 million and
  2.4 million every month from 2005 to 2017. The research monitored search terms such
  as "cannabis," "weed," "marijuana" and "pot," combined with action words like "order,"
  "shop," "buy" and more. Some websites that freely sell cannabis have already been
  taken down, but knowing the internet, surely there are thousands more possible sources.
  University College Cork, Ireland professor Theodore Caputi, one of the lead authors
  of the study, was quoted by Study Finds as saying that despite the legalization
  of marijuana in some U.S. states, online selling disables the government from collecting
  the necessary taxes that would help support the cost of providing public health
  services related to its use. In addition, its instant availability only creates
  greater dependence that covers even the very young. Recreational marijuana for users
  over the age of 21 is currently legal in 10 U.S. states. Medical use is allowed
  in 33 states.'
