summary: 'To rewind from the #MeToo juggernaut of 2018: The MeToo movement was founded
  by American civil rights activist Tarana Burke in 2006. "Sorry [festival] board
  members, you missed standing by the #MeToo movement by a mile." Its useful to look
  at the MeToo movement in terms of economist Joseph Schumpeters idea of "creative
  destruction". But these are not failures of the #MeToo movement. The MeToo hashtag
  has given women a vocabulary that acts as an arsenal.'
