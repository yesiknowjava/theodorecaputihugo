article: 'Many more abuse-deterrent formulations are entering the market to help curb
  the abuse of immediate-release products. But this does not mean these products are
  safer. The FDA approved Hysingla ER (hydrocodone bitartrate) in 2014. It is an acetaminophen-free,
  extended-release (ER) opioid for severe pain requiring daily, long-term treatment
  and for which no alternatives exist for the patient. The lack of acetaminophen (Tylenol)
  in the product can help to lower the risk of toxicity due to excessive doses of
  acetaminophen. As with other abuse-deterrent forms, Hysingla ER abuse-deterrent
  properties may reduce, but not totally prevent, abuse of the drug. People can still
  abuse it by swallowing the intact tablet. Do not drink alcohol or take benzodiazepines
  or other nervous system depressant-type medicines with Hysingla ER. Dangerous side
  effects or death could occur. Swallow Hysingla ER whole if you are prescribed this
  medicine. Do not cut, break, chew, crush, dissolve, snort, or inject Hysingla ER
  because this may cause you to overdose and die. Crushing, chewing, or dissolving
  the tablets can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of
  hydrocodone. The tablet forms a thick gel and cannot be easily prepared for injection,
  and resists passage through a hypodermic needle. Serious, life-threatening, or fatal
  respiratory depression may occur with use of Hysingla ER, and even once dose in
  a child can be fatal. Keep out of reach and out of sight of children in a secure
  location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home. The most common
  side effects of Hysingla ER are constipation, nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. Other
  long-acting, but abuse-deterrent, pain medications include:'

  <p>If you recognize signs of addiction in someone, strongly consider taking steps
  to help guide them to recovery. It may be as simple as giving them a ride to the
  doctor, or providing a local recovery group phone number. You could help save a
  life.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive evaluation, including medical, psychological and social risks,
  can help identify the various causes of the individual''s drug abuse and addiction.
  Other medical issues, such as hepatitis C, HIV or mental health issues can also
  be identified and addressed. The need for social services, such as housing or food
  needs, can be addressed.</p>

  <ul> <li>The first goal of addiction is a safe and successful <a href="https://www.drugs.com/condition/opiate-dependence.html">detoxification</a>
  (drug withdrawal) in a medically supervised facility.</li> <li>During detoxification
  in a hospital or clinic, the dose of the drug (or another substitute) is gradually
  reduced to lessen the negative effects of withdrawal. This is safely performed under
  medical supervision.</li> <li>Maintenance treatment can then help to prevent further
  abuse of potent and possibly fatal narcotics. Maintenance medications may include:
  <a href="https://www.drugs.com/sublocade.html">Sublocade</a>, <a href="https://www.drugs.com/vivitrol.html">Vivitrol</a>,
  <a href="https://www.drugs.com/suboxone.html">Suboxone</a>, or<a href="https://www.drugs.com/zubsolv.html">
  Zubsolv</a>.</li> <li>Behavioral treatment, counseling or group therapy can bolster
  a successful medical treatment.</li> </ul>

  <p>If you are a caregiver or housemate of someone you know with an opioid addiction
  or who uses high doses of opioids, get the opiate reversal agent naloxone (<a href="https://www.drugs.com/narcan.html">Narcan,
  Narcan Nasal</a>) from your pharmacy to have on hand in case of an overdose emergency.
  Many U.S pharmacists can now provide this without a prescription.</p>

  <p>Consider calling the National Substance Abuse Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357)
  for free and confidential treatment referral.</p>'
