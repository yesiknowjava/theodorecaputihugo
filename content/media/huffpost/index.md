article: '(Reuters Health) - - Lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBQ) teens
  are more than three times as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers,
  a U.S. study suggests. In a national survey of almost 16,000 youth, about 25 percent
  of LBGQ teens said they had attempted suicide at least once in the previous year,
  compared with roughly 6 percent of heterosexual teens, researchers report in the
  Journal of the American Medical Association. Sexual minority youth were also more
  than twice as likely to contemplate suicide or plan a suicide attempt even if they
  didnt go through with it, the study also found. "LGBQ teens face staggeringly high
  suicide risks," said senior study author John Ayers, a researcher at San Diego State
  University. "We must recognize LGBQ teen suicide is a national public health crisis
  and bring extraordinary resources to bear to address the crisis," Ayers said by
  email. While some previous research has pointed to the increased suicide risks for
  sexual minority teens, the current study offers fresh evidence from a large, nationally
  representative survey of U.S. high school students. Overall, 89 percent of the participants
  identified themselves as heterosexual in the 2015 survey. Another 2 percent identified
  as gay or lesbian, while 6 percent said they were bisexual and 3.2 percent said
  they were questioning or unsure about their sexual identity. To assess suicide risk,
  participants were asked how many times in the past year they had seriously considered
  suicide, planned a suicide attempt or tried to kill themselves. Among sexual minorities,
  40 percent of the teens said they had considered suicide and 35 percent of them
  planned a suicide attempt, the study found. By contrast, 15 percent of heterosexual
  adolescents said they had considered suicide and 12 percent said they had planned
  a suicide attempt. The increased suicide risk for sexual minority teens held true
  when researchers looked at females and males separately. Lesbians were more than
  twice as likely to attempt suicide as heterosexual young women, and the odds were
  more than tripled for bisexuals. Gay teens were more than four times as likely to
  attempt suicide as heterosexual males, while bisexuals had more than five times
  the risk. The study wasnt a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how
  sexual orientation might influence suicide risk. Researchers also lacked data on
  gender identity or transgender youth, who may have an even higher risk of suicide
  than gay and bisexual teens. Even so, the results add to the evidence suggesting
  that sexual minority teens have a higher risk of suicide than other youth, said
  Hongying Dai, a researcher at Childrens Mercy Hospital and the University of Missouri-Kansas
  City who wasnt involved in the study. While the study didnt address what might have
  driven teens to consider or attempt suicide, its possible sexual minority teens
  might have been at increased risk because they experienced verbal harassment, physical
  bullying or felt unsafe at school, Dai said by email. Advertisement "Studies have
  linked high levels of stress due to social stigma, marginalization, discrimination
  and experiences of bullying with a wide range of risky health behaviors, including
  suicidal behaviors," Dai said. Parents may help reduce this stress by talking to
  their kids, said Kimberly McManama, a psychiatry researcher at Boston Childrens
  Hospital and Harvard Medical School who wasnt involved in the study. "Talk to your
  kids about their sexual and gender identity early and often," McManama said by email.
  "Let them know that whatever they are feeling is ok with you and that you are ready
  and willing to talk about it with them when they are." SOURCE: bit.ly/2CGxsDv JAMA,
