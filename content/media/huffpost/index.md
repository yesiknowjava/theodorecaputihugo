summary: Sexual minority youth were also more than twice as likely to contemplate
  suicide or plan a suicide attempt even if they didnt go through with it, the study
  also found. To assess suicide risk, participants were asked how many times in the
  past year they had seriously considered suicide, planned a suicide attempt or tried
  to kill themselves. Among sexual minorities, 40 percent of the teens said they had
  considered suicide and 35 percent of them planned a suicide attempt, the study found.
  By contrast, 15 percent of heterosexual adolescents said they had considered suicide
  and 12 percent said they had planned a suicide attempt. The increased suicide risk
  for sexual minority teens held true when researchers looked at females and males
  separately.
