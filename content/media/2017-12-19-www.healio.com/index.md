  were significantly more likely to report that they considered, planned or attempted
  suicide compared with heterosexual teenagers in the United States, according to
  2015 national survey data published in JAMA. "Sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual,
  or questioning) adolescents are believed to have elevated suicide risks. Studies
  supporting this claim, however, rarely use nationally representative samples, which
  is a major limitation given that stigma and prevention resources vary across communities
  and may influence suicide risk behaviors," John W. Ayers, PhD, adjunct associate
  professor at San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health, and colleagues
  wrote. "When nationally representative studies are available, they are not recent.
  Moreover, studies have ignored the diversity among sexual minorities, assuming all
  share the same risks." To determine suicide risk behaviors among sexual minority
  adolescents in high school, researchers used nationally representative data from
  the 2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Participants responded privately to
  questionnaires via computer that asked whether they had seriously considered, planned
  or attempted suicide in the past year. The investigators used the answers to compare
  these suicide risk behaviors between sexual minority teenagers and heterosexuals.
  Overall, 15,624 participants reported their sexual orientation as heterosexual,
  gay or lesbian, bisexual or questioning. In the past year, 40% of sexual minority
  adolescents reported seriously considering suicide (95% CI, 36.4-42.9); 34.9% reported
  planning suicide, (95% CI, 31.1- 38.6); and 24.9% reported attempting suicide (95%
  CI, 21.5- 28.2) compared with 14.8% (95% CI, 13.7-15.9) of heterosexuals considering;
  11.9% (95% CI, 10.7-13) planning; and 6.3% (95% CI, 5.5-7.2) attempting suicide.
  Compared with heterosexuals, sexual minority teenagers were significantly more likely
  to consider (RR = 2.45; 95% CI, 2.12-2.81), plan (RR = 2.59; 95% CI, 2.18-3.04)
  and attempt (RR = 3.37; 95% CI, 2.73-4.09) suicide, after adjusting for confounders.
  Analysis of sexual minority subgroups showed that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning
  teens were all at elevated risk for suicide relative to heterosexuals. Bisexual
  adolescents were 46% more likely to consider, 40.8% more likely to plan or 31.9%
  more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual adolescents. Differences persisted
  after stratifying by sex and controlling for cofounders; for example, 40% of lesbians
  reported considering suicide vs. 19.6% of heterosexual females and 25.5% of gay
  males reported considering suicide vs. 10.6% of heterosexual. "The substantial suicide
  risks among sexual minorities merits a comprehensive reaction. Policy makers should
  invest in research to understand and prevent suicide among sexual minorities," Ayers
  and colleagues wrote. "Clinicians should discuss sexual orientation with patients,
  and allocate appropriate mental health resources. Caretakers should watch for signs
  of suicide risk behaviors among sexual minority adolescents, and seek supportive
  help when warranted." - by Savannah Demko Disclosure : The authors report no relevant
