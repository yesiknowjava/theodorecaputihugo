article: 'In what the research team labeled "astonishing" and an "earth-shaking event,"
  according to reports of a study published Friday, renowned actor Charlie Sheen saved
  lives by revealing he tested positive for HIV. The "Two And A Half Men" actor made
  the announcement on Nov. 17, 2015, on NBCs Today Show. A study conducted by San
  Diego State University (SDSU) researchers last year showed how him revealing his
  HIV status urged millions of people to undergo HIV tests. The study also revealed
  there was a surge in online searches about HIV prevention measures, reported ABC

  Year Later According to the study, popularly known as the "Charlie Sheen Effect"
  the sales of at-home testing nearly doubled days after his announcement, the report
  said. The study was conducted by various institutions. It was published in the medical
  journal of Prevention Science Friday, ABC news report said. "Our strategy allowed
  us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention
  and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,"
  Eric Leas, a research associate at the San Diego State Universitys doctoral program
  in public health said in a statement Friday. The analysts narrowed down their research
  to weekly analysis from April 12, 2016, to April 16, 2016, and took OraQuick rapid
  in-home HIV tests as their sample. Since OraQuick was the only test of this kind
  available in the U.S., it became much easier for the research. After conducting
  the research, analysts found out that the week after Sheen announced his HIV status,
  there was a 95% spike in OraQuick HIV test sales. After the successful completion
  of this small research project, analysts continued to track sales figures which
  were constantly above normal for the next four weeks, the ABC report said. And if
  that wasnt all, researchers found the sales figures exceeded the ones after World
  Aids Day. "People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that''s
  being generated is not useful to regular people. But it reminds us that, regardless
  of who the person is, it will at least generate interest," Dr. Barron Lerner, a
  professor at NYU Langone Medical Center, said. "Just like everybody, I watched on
  the Today Show when Sheen disclosed his HIV status, but when I watched it as a public
  health advocate, I saw that neither Sheen nor [Matt] Lauer was talking about HIV
  prevention," Dr. John Ayers, a scientist at the SDSU told Global news. "The headlines
  after that said little about HIV prevention, and I thought, ''Thats sad, because
  wouldnt it be great to get the positive message out there? The message has been
  consistent: know the signs and get tested," he added. Turns out the news of his
  HIV status itself was enough to increase HIV awareness among Americans.'
