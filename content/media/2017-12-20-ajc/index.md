  Black, gay and proud: one man''s quest to thrive In fact, about 25 percent of LGBQ
  teens said they attempted suicide at least once within the last year, compared to
  just six percent of heterosexual youth. Furthermore, 40 percent of LGBQ youth said
  they seriously considered suicide and 35 percent of LGBQ kids had actually planned
  a suicide, compared to 15 and 12 percent of heterosexual teens, respectively. Researchers
  lacked data on gender identity or transgender youth, who may have an even higher
  risk of suicide than gay and bisexual teens. When they took a closer look at the
  data, they discovered the risk for LGBQ males was even higher. Nearly 39 percent
  of bisexual boys had considered suicide. "There have been some indications that
  LGBQ youth face increased suicide risks, yet many believed the jury was still out,"
  coauthor John Ayers said in a statement. "Our study yields a clear verdict: LGBQ
  youth face staggeringly high suicide risks." Researchers now hope their findings
  help bring about change. They are encouraging health, political and social leaders
  to create strategies to help combat the issue. "Our work has identified a serious
  problem, but fortunately decades of science and experience can be leveraged to address
  LGBQ youth''s suicide risk," Ayers said. "Now is the time to act." >>RELATED: Gay

  <p>To do so, they surveyed 16,000 youth in 2015, and the questionnaire focused on
  topics including sexuality and mental health.</p>

  <p>Overall, 89 percent of the participants said they were heterosexual. About two
  percent identified as gay or lesbian and six percent were bisexual. About 3.2 percent
  said they were questioning or unsure.</p>
