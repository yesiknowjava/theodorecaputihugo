summary: The FDA approved Hysingla ER (hydrocodone bitartrate) in 2014. As with other
  abuse-deterrent forms, Hysingla ER abuse-deterrent properties may reduce, but not
  totally prevent, abuse of the drug. Do not drink alcohol or take benzodiazepines
  or other nervous system depressant-type medicines with Hysingla ER. Do not cut,
  break, chew, crush, dissolve, snort, or inject Hysingla ER because this may cause
  you to overdose and die. The most common side effects of Hysingla ER are constipation,
  nausea, fatigue, and dizziness.
