article: 'A new ''smokeless'' tobacco cigarettes has been hailed as a safer alternative
  to traditional smoking. Now experts predict that heat-not-burn devices are set soar
  in popularity. A study suggests they will overtake sales of e-cigarettes, which
  are used by an estimated 9 million adults in the US and around 2.9 million in the
  UK. This has caused campaigners to warn there is an ''urgent need'' for more research
  into the health effects of devices which heat tobacco as opposed to burning it.
  The team from the US analysed Google search trends relating to the heat-not-burn
  devices in Japan, which was the first country to sell them. Their findings showed
  a huge surge in demand for the items - rising by 2,956 per cent in the two years
  from 2015 to 2017. It''s now expected that the same could happen in other countries,
  after the first heat-not-burn device became available in the UK in November last
  year and products entered the FDA-approval process in the US in May. Experts say
  they expect a huge surge in demand for heat-not-burn devices (stock image) WHAT
  ARE HEAT-NOT-BURN E-CIGARETTES? Heat-not-burn e-cigarettes were originally created
  by tobacco giant Philip Morris International. They were behind a smokeless device
  known as IQOS, that is said to contain 90 per cent less toxins that ordinary ones.
  Different from e-cigarettes, the electronic device is used with mini tobacco sticks,
  in the form of Marlboro HeatSticks or others, as opposed to a nicotine-laced liquid.
  These are then placed into the device before being heated, which experts say makes
  them much less harmful because they aren''t burning the tobacco. But experts argue
  that the innovative device will never be safer than e-cigarettes and doesn''t appear
  to be a safe option. Advertisement Study coauthor Mark Dredze, professor of computer
  science at Johns Hopkins University, said: ''Heat-not-burn products have quickly
  become insanely popular. ''Two years ago, there were essentially no queries in Japan
  for heat-not-burn tobacco, but now there are between 5.9 and 7.5 million each month.''
  Furthermore, the team found that interest in heat-not-burn tobacco in Japan is rising
  more rapidly than past interest in e-cigarettes when they were first introduced
  to market. The study authors added: ''This suggests that as heat-not-burn tobacco
  is introduced in new markets, its popularity may even eclipse e-cigarettes.'' Throat-hit
  appeal The new products gently heat tobacco to a balmy 260degC to produce a tobacco
  vapour. Co-author Dr John Ayers, an associate research professor at the San Diego
  State University, said heat-not-burn devices appeal to smokers who still demand
  the ''throat-hit'' delivered by a regular cigarette. This hit isn''t obtained by
  most e-cigs, because they vapourise nicotine - the addictive part of a cigarette
  - but they don''t contain any tobacco. Independent research is needed Tobacco kills
  up to half of its users - that''s more than seven million people each year, according
  to the World Health Organization. And while the jury is still largely out on the
  long-term effects of vaping, heat-not-burn devices are currently only on sale in
  a handful of places around the world and little is known about their credentials.
  As with many e-cigs, the devices are produced and sold by the big tobacco companies,
  eager not to lose business as more and more people quit smoking. Now public health
  officials who were ''caught off guard'' by e-cigarettes, are being urged to get
  clued up now and set the agenda before the tobacco giants get their first. ''Tobacco
  companies try to outmaneuver public health protections by creating new products
  that make tobacco appear less dangerous and more appealing,'' said Theodore Caputi,
  a Mitchell Scholar and the study''s first author. ''People were caught off guard
  by e-cigarettes, for example. Our study is an early warning and a call to action
  for public health professionals to address heat-not-burn products now.'' Campaign
  group ASH said because of the tobacco industry''s ''long record of deceit over the
  health risks of smoking'', there is an ''urgent need'' for independent research
  into these new devices. Smoke released by these heat-not-burn e-cigarette devices
  contain 84 per cent of the nicotine found in traditional cigarettes, a previous
  study shows (pictured: the IQOS cigarette by Philip Morris International) HOW MUCH
  SAFER ARE ''SMOKELESS'' CIGARETTES? They''ve been touted as the safest way of smoking
  in recent years. But research in May suggests ''smokeless'' cigarettes may contain
  more cancer-causing chemicals than believed. Smoking giant Philip Morris markets
  its IQOS device, which tobacco sticks can be placed into to be heated, as containing
  90 per cent less toxins. However, a study found it contains some chemicals that
  are strongly linked to cancer in much higher concentrations than previously reported.
  These included carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons, scientists said. While the smoke of this gadget still has 84 per cent
  of the nicotine found in traditional cigarettes. Advertisement In the mean time,
  heat-not-burn products must face the same strict regulation as cigarettes said chief
  executive Deborah Arnott. She told The Sun Online: ''From what we know so far, it
  is likely heat-not-burn products are less harmful than smoking, but more harmful
  than electronic cigarettes. ''However, unless and until independent evidence shows
  that these products are substantially less harmful than smoking, they should be
  regulated in the same way as other tobacco products. ''Fully independent research
  and assessment will be crucial if heat-not-burn tobacco products are to be accepted
  as useful in fighting the smoking epidemic.'' Dr Ayers said that tobacco control
  is ''at a new crossroads''. ''Leaders can reasonably respond to this new data and
  ready themselves by setting an agenda or wait for big tobacco to set the heat-not-burn
  agenda for them,'' he explained. The new findings are published today in the journal
  PLOS One.'
