  Philip Morris THURSDAY, Jan. 25, 2017 -- Controversial "heat-not-burn" tobacco devices
  might only get limited marketing in the United States, based on recommendations
  issued Thursday by an influential government panel. These devices are different
  than e-cigarettes, in that instead of heating a nicotine-infused liquid, they warm
  up tobacco to about 500 degrees Fahrenheit, producing an inhalable aerosol. Advertisement
  A panel of advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been examining
  an application from tobacco giant Phillip Morris to market such a device, called
  iQOS, in the United States. The device is already sold in 30 countries. However,
  on Thursday the FDA panel rejected Philip Morris' proposal that it market iQOS as
  a lower-risk alternative to cigarettes -- one that would cut a user's risk for disease
  compared to "regular" smoking. But in another decision, the panel said it would
  endorse a second claim -- that iQOS exposes users to lower levels of toxic chemicals
  compared to cigarettes. That could open the door to the tobacco company marketing
  the device in the United States, but in a more restricted way. The FDA is expected
  to decide whether Philip Morris can sell iQOS within the next few months. The agency
  is not obligated to follow the recommendations of its advisory panels, but it usually
  does. Advertisement Research on the potential health impact of such devices has
  barely begun. One recent study, published in October, found that in countries where
  the product is already on the market, like Japan, it has achieved rapid popularity
  as a smoke-free option for those e-smokers who yearn for the old taste and back-of-throat
  burning sensation, or "hit," of traditional cigarettes. Still, "we don't know enough
  about the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco products, and that lack of
  knowledge is extremely dangerous for public health," Theodore Caputi, the study's
  lead author, said at the time of publication. He's a graduate student in public
  health at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
  "We know from experience that the tobacco industry and their allies will not wait
  for all the facts to begin making health claims," he added. "We need to first ensure,
  before heat-not-burn reaches the market, that consumers are aware we don't have
  all the facts on heat-not-burn products, and then we should begin filling in those
  knowledge gaps," Caputi said. He said that "considering the absolutely massive public
  health implications of tobacco products, generally -- that is, tobacco use is the
  leading cause of preventable death -- picking up a heat-not-burn device before we
  have all the facts is not a decision consumers should take lightly." Advertisement
  Caputi and his colleagues published their study online Oct. 11 in the journal PLOS
  One. To get a handle on the potential popularity of heat-not-burn devices in the
  American marketplace, the researchers looked at Google search patterns in Japan
  to gauge shifting interest in the mechanism. They found that heat-not-burn Google
  searches in Japan spiked by more than 1,400 percent in 2015, when the devices were
  first released in that country, and by nearly 3,000 percent between 2015 and 2017.
  There are now as many as 7.5 million searches a month in Japan. That trend reflects
  an even greater interest than that seen when e-cigarettes were first introduced
  in the Japanese market, the study authors said. Study co-author John Ayers is a
  research professor at the San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health.
  He said, "Unfortunately, we don't know what the health implications are for heat-not-burn
  tobacco. Our study simply shows these products are insanely popular in Japan, their
  only national test market. "Even if interest in these products is just one-tenth
  as much in the U.S., it suggests many millions will seek out these products," Ayers
  added. According to Caputi, "the available evidence does suggest that heat-not-burn
  tobacco products -- if they're approved by the FDA -- will be coming to a store
  near you." Because of that, "we need to combat unfounded claims surrounding the
  health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco products," he said. Advertisement "For
  example, e-cigarettes are banned from being marketed as safe or even as cessation
  tools because there is insufficient data to back up those arguments, and yet we
  know those claims are routinely made and understood," Caputi said. "Public health
  professionals need to form a strategy to ensure that same problem doesn't happen
  to heat-not-burn products." More information The FDA has more about nicotine and
