article: 'FRIDAY, Dec. 21, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Hundreds of thousands of women
  have used the #MeToo hashtag to speak out about sexual harassment and assault during
  the past year. Now there''s evidence that the #MeToo movement sparked more than
  mere conversation about sexual abuse in the United States. Google searches for information
  about sexual harassment and assault -- as well as reporting or preventing such behavior
  -- spiked in the months after actress Alyssa Milano brought the #MeToo movement
  fresh attention in October 2017, a study published online Dec. 21 in JAMA Internal
  Medicine found. "Our study reveals that even months after the beginning of #MeToo,
  millions more than otherwise expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online,"
  said senior researcher John Ayers, an associate adjunct professor with the University
  of California, San Diego. "Revealing this record-setting and sustained engagement
  is a call to action for the nation." Searches related to sexual harassment and assault
  were 51 percent higher than expected between Oct. 15, 2017 and June 15, 2018, Ayers
  and his colleagues found. On the afternoon of Oct. 15, 2017, Milano responded to
  public accusations of sexual harassment and assault against film producer Harvey
  Weinstein with a tweet sent to her followers: "If you''ve been sexually harassed
  or assaulted write ''me too'' as a reply to this tweet." Searches related to reporting
  sexual assault and preventive training on sexual harassment were 30 percent higher
  during that same period, researchers found. "#MeToo is not the first movement to
  empower victims of sexual violence, but what is unique compared to past movements
  is #MeToo''s staying power," Ayers said. "Eight months since the initiation of #MeToo,
  millions more than expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. #MeToo''s
  sustainability, and our study alerting leaders to this, could yield major wins for
  the nation''s public health." These findings verify that #MeToo made a real difference
  in terms of raising awareness and prompting action, said Karestan Koenen, a professor
  of psychiatric epidemiology with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in
  Boston. "Anecdotally, we''ve known it''s made a difference," Koenen said. "I feel
  like this is some of the first real data we have that these aren''t just anecdotes,
  that this movement is making a huge difference." Sharyn Tejani, director of the
  Time''s Up Legal Defense Fund, has been on the receiving end of those Google searches.
  The National Women''s Law Center created the defense fund in January 2018, in the
  wake of #MeToo. "Since then, over 3,800 people have reached out to us seeking assistance
  for workplace sexual harassment," Tejani said. "People send us requests for assistance
  online, and so it does seem like people are using online tools. We''ve received
  many more requests for assistance than we ever thought we would receive." Koenen
  found the searches related to reporting or preventing sexual harassment to be most
  promising. "As a trauma psychologist, I know sharing one''s sexual assault experiences
  can be very validating and healing for people, but beyond that, what we want to
  see is change," she said. "That''s the most exciting finding to me, because it''s
  going beyond all of us sharing this experience. Maybe people are taking action that
  will really result in change." The response to the #MeToo movement has revealed
  a huge public health problem in the United States that must be addressed, Ayers
  said. "Survivors face serious health consequences, including physical injury, PTSD
  symptoms and emotional trauma," Ayers said. "Yet public investments in preventing
  and responding to sexual violence is disproportionately small compared with other
  health issues. With millions more than ever voicing their needs, our nation''s leaders
  should respond by investing in enhanced prevention training and improving resources
  for survivors." More information The National Women''s Law Center has more about
