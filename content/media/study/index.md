summary: A recent study finds that millions of Americans are seeking out and finding
  online cannabis retailers, even if they reside in states that havent legalized the
  drug -- and even if they arent of legal age. Three out of every four search queries
  showed cannabis delivery services on the first page of results. But online sales
  of the drug are illegal, even in these states that have legalized or partially legalized
  it. "Children could obtain marijuana online without safeguards to protect them,"
  says lead author Theodore Caputi, of University College Cork in Ireland. "States
  that have legalized marijuana might not be able to collect taxes to offset the public
  health costs of legal marijuana from online retailers, and the instant online availability
  of marijuana could increase marijuana dependence among all age groups."The study
  was published in American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
