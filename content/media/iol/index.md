summary: Durban - Gay teenagers were almost five times as likely to show a higher
  prevalence for suicide-risk behaviour than their heterosexual peers, a research
  has showed. Nearly a quarter of LGBQ adolescents attempted suicide compared to approximately
  six per cent of those in the sexual majority. Further, variations in risk between
  those who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or queer were also observed. Nearly one-third
  of bisexual adolescents reported attempting suicide in the past 12 months, and 46
  per cent had considered it. For the study, published in the Journal of the American
  Medical Association, the team surveyed 15,624 high-school age participants.
