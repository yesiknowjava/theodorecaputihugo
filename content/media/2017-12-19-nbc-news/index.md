article: Both LGBQ sexual identity and traumatic experiences in childhood are linked
  to a heightened risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, U.S. researchers say. Teens
  who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or are questioning their sexual identity
  are also more likely than their heterosexual peers to have had adverse childhood
  experiences (ACEs) in childhood, the study team reports in Journal of Adolescent
  Health. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and young
  adults, and there is evidence that suicide rates are increasing in this age group,
  they write. "It is imperative that we identify adolescent populations at greatest
  risk to guide our prevention efforts," lead author Kristen Clements-Nolle, of the
  School of Community Health Sciences of the University of Nevada, Reno, told Reuters
  Health by email. "Furthermore, cumulative exposure to ACEs greatly increased suicide
  risk behaviors among sexual minority adolescents. For example, compared with heterosexual
  students with no exposure to ACEs, LGB/not sure students with two or more ACEs had
  approximately 13 times higher odds of attempting suicide in the past year," Clements-Nolle
  said. To examine the relationships among teen sexual identity, childhood trauma
  and suicide risk, Clements-Nolle and colleagues enrolled approximately 5,000 students
  from 97 high schools in Nevada to fill out questionnaires and answer questions about
  their sexual identity and exposure to adverse childhood experiences. Adverse childhood
  events included such things as being physically forced to have sex with someone,
  or being beaten, kicked or physically hurt by an adult. In addition, students were
  asked about their exposure to domestic violence, mental illness and substance abuse
  by family members. Participants were also asked if they had ever seriously considered
  suicide during the past year and how many times had they attempted suicide during
  that time. About 10 percent of students self-identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual
  (LGB), and nearly 5 percent were not sure of their sexual identity. Just over 85
  percent of students identified as heterosexual. The LGB and questioning students
  were more likely to be exposed to adverse childhood events. More than half of LGB
  and 40 percent of questioning students reported at least two ACEs, compared to about
  one-quarter of heterosexual students reporting the same exposure. For all students,
  the greater the number of adverse experiences they reported, the greater was their
  risk of having had suicidal thoughts during the past year. Sexual identity was also
  linked to risk of suicidal thinking. Compared with heterosexual students with no
  ACEs, LGB and questioning students overall were three times more likely to report
  suicidal thoughts. LGB and questioning students who reported one ACE were almost
  7 times more likely to think about suicide compared to heterosexual students with
  one ACE. With three or more ACEs, LGB and questioning students were 14 times more
  likely to think about suicide compared to heterosexual counterparts. Compared to
  heterosexual students with no ACEs, LGB and unsure students were almost 4 times
  more likely to have attempted suicide. "Studies have shown that family acceptance
  and parental caring may reduce suicidal behaviors among LGB adolescents and young
  adults," Clements-Nolle said. Future research should evaluate whether interventions
  that support families with sexual minority youth and promote acceptance of adolescent
  sexual identity can also impact childhood victimization and household dysfunction,
  said Clements-Nolle. "While the assessment of intervention effectiveness was beyond
  the scope of the current study, the higher prevalence of ACEs among adolescents
  who are LGB or are not sure of their sexual identity and the demonstrated influence
  on suicide risk behaviors highlight the need to ensure that suicide prevention efforts
  for sexual minority youth are trauma-informed," Clements-Nolle said. FOLLOW NBC
