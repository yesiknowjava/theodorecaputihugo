summary: Actor Charlie Sheens disclosure that he is HIV positive appears to have had
  a striking effect on sales of home HIV testing kits, a new study suggests. "Its
  hard to appreciate the magnitude of Sheens disclosure," study co-author Benjamin
  Althouse, a research scientist with the Institute of Disease Modeling in Bellevue,
  Washington, said in a statement. "When we compared Sheens disclosure to other traditional
  awareness campaigns, the 'Charlie Sheen effect is astonishing," Althouse said. Previously,
  the same researchers found that, after Sheens HIV disclosure, there was a large
  uptick in internet searches for information on HIV testing and prevention. The new
  findings also suggest that internet search data can be a good predictor of peoples
  actual health behaviors, given that peoples internet searches for HIV testing information
  corresponded with an increase in HIV testing kit sales, the researchers said.
