article: Actor Charlie Sheens disclosure that he is HIV positive appears to have had
  a striking effect on sales of home HIV testing kits, a new study suggests. Researchers
  found that, after Sheen announced he had HIV on Nov. 17, 2015, sales of home HIV
  testing kits doubled in the United States -- from about 3,500 kits per week before
  the announcement, to 7,000 kits the week of the announcement. And this boost in
  sales continued for several more weeks. Advertisement "Its hard to appreciate the
  magnitude of Sheens disclosure," study co-author Benjamin Althouse, a research scientist
  with the Institute of Disease Modeling in Bellevue, Washington, said in a statement.
  "When we compared Sheens disclosure to other traditional awareness campaigns, the
  'Charlie Sheen effect is astonishing," Althouse said. [10 Celebrities with Chronic
  Illnesses] In fact, the researchers estimated that sales of home HIV testing kits
  were nearly eight times greater around the time of Sheens announcement, compared
  with sales around the time of World AIDS Day (December 1), one of the most high-profile
  HIV awareness campaigns. Previously, the same researchers found that, after Sheens
  HIV disclosure, there was a large uptick in internet searches for information on
  HIV testing and prevention. In the new study, the researchers wanted to know whether
  this increase in internet searches corresponded to an increase in people actually
  getting tested for HIV. Advertisement So the researchers collected data on weekly
  sales of OraQuick, an in-home HIV testing kit. OraQuick is one of only two home
  HIV testing kits currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and OraQuick
  is the only kit that allows users to get their results at home within minutes of
  taking the test, rather than sending their sample to a lab to be tested. The researchers
  estimated that there were 8,225 more kits sold over the weeks following Sheens disclosure
  than would have been expected based on prior sales of the product. The findings
  "reinforce how celebrity can impact health decision-making...and make an even stronger
  case that Sheens disclosure promoted HIV prevention," the researchers wrote in their
  findings, published today (May 18) in the journal Prevention Science. Celebrities
  have been known to influence rates of health screenings. In 2013, there was a rise
  in rates of genetic testing for breast cancer genes after actress Angelina Jolie
  disclosed that she was a carrier of the BRCA gene, and had undergone a double mastectomy
  to lower her risk of developing the disease. Advertisement The new findings also
  suggest that internet search data can be a good predictor of peoples actual health
  behaviors, given that peoples internet searches for HIV testing information corresponded
  with an increase in HIV testing kit sales, the researchers said.
