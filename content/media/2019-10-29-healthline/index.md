article: Share on Pinterest Researchers are learning how cannabis compounds affect
  people. Getty Images Theres not enough scientific evidence to recommend cannabinoids
  for treating mental health conditions, a new study finds. Products with THC or CBD
  have been used in recent years as a way to self-medicate for certain mental health
  conditions. Experts say people pursuing these options need to be careful and talk
  with their physician. Consumer interest in using cannabis -- especially cannabidiol,
  or CBD -- to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions has increased
  sharply in the past few years. This trend is driven in part by celebrities like
  Jennifer Aniston and Kristen Bell who are embracing CBD as a way to ease their symptoms
  of anxiety and depression. But the buzz around the mental health benefits of cannabinoids
  -- which includes cannabis and compounds like CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC
  -- has far outpaced the science, suggests a major new study . Researchers found
  that theres "inadequate evidence" available to suggest that cannabinoids can improve
  the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. "Based
  on this evidence, physicians should refrain from recommending cannabinoids to their
  patients for the treatment of mental health disorders," said Dr. Elina Drits, associate
  chair of psychiatry at Staten Island University Hospital in Staten Island, New York.
  Little evidence of THC and CBD for mental illness The researchers analysis included
  83 studies from 1980 through 2018 that looked at the use of cannabinoids to treat
  symptoms of mental health conditions. This included studies looking at the treatment
  of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit
  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), psychosis, and Tourette syndrome. Only 40 studies
  were randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for medical evidence. Most
  of these were small -- with fewer than 40 people each -- and ran for only 4 to 5
  weeks. Researchers did find that pharmaceutical THC -- with or without CBD -- reduced
  symptoms of anxiety in people with other medical conditions, compared to a nonactive
  placebo. However, Dr. Roopali Parikh, MD, a psychiatrist specializing in substance
  use disorder at Northwell Health Physician Partners Behavioral Health Group Practice
  in Manhasset, New York, pointed out that this evidence was of "low quality" and
  based on only seven studies with a total of 252 patients. There was no impact of
  pharmaceutical THC -- with or without CBD -- on depression symptoms. Most of the
  studies for anxiety and depression were for conditions like chronic, noncancer pain
  and multiple sclerosis, with anxiety or depression as a secondary symptom. THC is
  the compound in cannabis that causes the "high," while CBD is nonintoxicating. Cannabis
  and some cannabis products contain both of these compounds in differing amounts.
  CBD oil is also available with no or very low amounts of THC. The reduction in anxiety
  symptoms seen in some studies may have been because the pharmaceutical THC relieved
  the symptoms of the main medical condition, write the authors in the paper. As for
  PTSD, ADHD, psychosis, and Tourette syndrome, the researchers found no evidence
  that any type of cannabinoid improved the symptoms. In fact, one study suggests
  that pharmaceutical THC made the symptoms of psychosis worse. In addition, pharmaceutical
  THC (with or without CBD) was linked to a twofold increase in adverse events, said
  Parikh, who wasnt involved in the study. There was also an almost threefold increase
  in people dropping out of the studies due to negative side effects, she said. Other
  research has shown that theres a significant risk of negative side effects from
  cannabinoid use -- not just addiction, but also depression, anxiety, and psychosis.

  has far outpaced the science, suggests a major new <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30401-8/fulltext">study</a>.</p>

  <p>Researchers found that there&rsquo;s &ldquo;inadequate evidence&rdquo; available
  to suggest that cannabinoids can improve the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and
  other mental health conditions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Based on this evidence, physicians should refrain from recommending cannabinoids

  increase in adverse events, said Parikh, who wasn&rsquo;t involved in the study.
  There was also an almost threefold increase in people dropping out of the studies
  due to negative side effects, she said.</p>

  <p>Other research has shown that there&rsquo;s a significant risk of <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/there-link-between-marijuana-use-psychiatric-disorders">negative
  side effects</a> from cannabinoid use &mdash; not just addiction, but also depression,
  anxiety, and psychosis.</p>

  <p>Many people with chronic pain turn to cannabinoids to treat their symptoms and
  avoid the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/prescribed.html#side-effects">serious
  side effects of long-term prescription opioid use</a>.</p>

  <p>But some <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395917300130">research</a>
  shows that a number of people use cannabinoids to treat a mental health disorder.
  This includes people with anxiety or depression who <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29525698">self-medicate
  with marijuana</a>.</p>

  <p>But this new study suggests that there isn&rsquo;t enough evidence yet to support
  the use of cannabinoids for mental health conditions. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that
  this won&rsquo;t change as future studies are completed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cannabinoids may have some beneficial potential for treatment and therefore
  should be studied,&rdquo; said Drits, who wasn&rsquo;t involved in the study.</p>

  <p>Parikh agreed that more data is needed, preferably from high-quality studies
  such as randomized controlled trials.</p>

  <p>The authors of the new paper point out that several studies are underway to look
  at the benefits of pharmaceutical CBD for specific conditions, including psychosis.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, people should be careful about using cannabinoids to treat a
  mental health condition, especially since <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/symptoms-causes/syc-20374968">untreated
  &mdash; or poorly treated &mdash; mental illness</a> may get worse.</p>

  <p>In some cases, using cannabinoids to treat a mental illness can also lead to
  a number of unwanted side effects.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What we see in our practice is that psychiatric symptoms can be worsened
  [by cannabinoids] &mdash; certainly the incidence of psychosis,&rdquo; said Parikh.</p>

  <p>Also, studies of cannabinoids often use pharmaceutical-grade products, which
  have a known dose and are free of harmful contaminants.</p>

  <p>The CBD or THC oils that you can buy at a dispensary &mdash; and especially at
  a gas station or local market &mdash; may not be <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/what-you-need-know-and-what-were-working-find-out-about-products-containing-cannabis-or-cannabis">the
  same high quality</a>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Many people who use cannabinoids in non-study settings are using the plant
  or oils,&rdquo; said Drits, &ldquo;which are not regulated and have been found to
  be mislabeled regardless of where they are purchased.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Even plant cannabis may not have the dose of CBD and THC needed to give the same
  effects as those seen in studies.</p>

  <p>If people do want to use these products to improve their mental health, it&rsquo;s
  best to avoid self-medicating, which can lead to serious consequences.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I recommend people work with a mental health provider they feel comfortable
  with,&rdquo; said Drits, &ldquo;to monitor them for improvement in their symptoms
  and for any potential adverse effects.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><strong>Is CBD Legal?</strong> <em> Hemp-derived CBD products (with less than
  0.3 percent THC) are legal on the federal level, but are still illegal under some
  <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx">state
  laws</a>. </em> <em>Marijuana-derived CBD products are illegal on the federal level,
