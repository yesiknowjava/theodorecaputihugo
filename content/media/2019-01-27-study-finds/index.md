article: SAN DIEGO -- Buying marijuana products apparently requires little more than
  a Google search and the click of a mouse, no matter who you are or where you live.
  A recent study finds that millions of Americans are seeking out and finding online
  cannabis retailers, even if they reside in states that havent legalized the drug
  -- and even if they arent of legal age. Researchers from several universities monitored
  Google searches and trends in the United States for queries made between 2005 and
  2017, looking for patterns in search trends relating to cannabis products. The team
  analyzed all searches containing common terms for cannabis, including "marijuana,"
  "weed," "cannabis," and "pot," combined with the words like "buy," "shop," "order,"
  and others. They eliminated irrelevant search queries such as "buy weed killer."
  Using the most common search queries, the researchers replicated the searches to
  see what sites showed on the first page of the search engine results. Forty-one
  percent of all search results for these queries were related to retailers offering
  mail-order marijuana, usually promising delivery to U.S. customers using a variety
  of shipping services, including private couriers, the U.S. Postal Service, and UPS.
  Three out of every four search queries showed cannabis delivery services on the
  first page of results. "Anyone, including teenagers, can search for and buy marijuana
  from their smartphone regardless of what state they live in," says lead researcher
  John W. Ayers, an associate professor at San Diego State Universitys Graduate School
  of Public Health, in a media release. Overall, marijuana shopping searches increased
  in the United States by nearly 300% between 2005 and 2017, with the highest number
  of searches originating from Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and Nevada -- all states
  that have legalized recreational marijuana sales in recent years. But online sales
  of the drug are illegal, even in these states that have legalized or partially legalized
  it. "Clearly these regulations are failing," says co-author Eric Leas, a research
  fellow at Stanford University. Researchers suggest that officials work with internet
  service providers to have these retailers removed from search engines as a means
  to curb illegal sales. Without such action, the consequences could be dire. "Children
  could obtain marijuana online without safeguards to protect them," says lead author
  Theodore Caputi, of University College Cork in Ireland. "States that have legalized
  marijuana might not be able to collect taxes to offset the public health costs of
  legal marijuana from online retailers, and the instant online availability of marijuana
  could increase marijuana dependence among all age groups." The study was published
  in American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Like studies? Follow us on Facebook!
