summary: The death by suicide of a 9-year-old Colorado fourth grader underscores the
  challenges surrounding youth mental health -- particularly the risks LGBTQ kids
  face. But, he says, lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer or questioning kids may face
  challenges that their peers dont. Knowing and being proactive about these risk factors,
  both experts say, could make a real difference in suicide prevention. But, he says,
  suicide prevention starts at home -- which may mean asking your child tough questions
  and guiding them toward help if theyre struggling. "We want the home to be a source
  where theres safety and security, and that promotes strong mental health and resilience."If
  you or someone you know may be contemplating suicide, call the National Suicide
  Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.
