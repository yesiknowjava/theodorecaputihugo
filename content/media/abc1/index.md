article: -- Charlie Sheen's 2015 announcement that he was diagnosed with HIV years
  earlier seems to have sparked higher interest in testing for the virus, according
  to a study released today. Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS,
  which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention
  to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what
  it called the "Charlie Sheen effect" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S.,
  with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers
  from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San
  Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal
  Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which
  documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. "Our strategy
  allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV
  prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet
  searches," study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State
  University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The
  researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016,
  of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the
  U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the "Today" show that he
  was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick
  HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four
  weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous
  level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales
  uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to
  get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that
  sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week.
  Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear
  for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware
  of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study
  could help public health officials better engage with people. "We can make public
  health more connected to the public it serves," he told ABC News. According to him,
  the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from
  experts. "We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging
  on." Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated
  with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small
  margin of error. "We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact
  and work to grow their impact," he said. "That's what public health can become."
  The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these
  public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and
  population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. "People look down at celebrities
  and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,"
  Lerner said. "But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at
  least generate interest." Ayers had a similar take. "It's an empowering message.
  The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,"
  he said. "We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true." Lerner said that Sheen's
  talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people
  about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and
  intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for
  HIV is "a good thing, regardless of who he is." Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this
  article. She is an anesthesiology resident at Massachusetts General Hospital and
  part of the ABC News medical unit.
