summary: According to the study update, what it called the "Charlie Sheen effect"
  had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly
  doubling the week of his announcement. They found that the week after Sheen announced
  on the "Today" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent
  increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal
  over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent
  above the previous level. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study
  could help public health officials better engage with people. "We can make public
  health more connected to the public it serves," he told ABC News.
