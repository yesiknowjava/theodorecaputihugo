article: 'In April of 2019, more people searched online for CBD than for acupuncture,
  apple cider vinegar, meditation, exercise, veganism, or vaccination (and that was
  during a measles outbreak). CBD, a chemical found in the cannabis plant, is having
  its moment, after being seized on by the wellness empire for its rumored ability
  to help with a whole host of conditions, from anxiety to insomnia to depression.
  The CBD industry is estimated to grow to almost $2 billion by 2022, and cannabis
  use overall has increased 43 percent between 2007 and 2015; it''s now medicinally
  legal in 33 states. But despite how ubiquitous CBD lattes may be, they are not matched
  by an equal amount of research on their benefits for the mind. Advertisement A new
  review and meta-analysis published this week in The Lancet Psychiatry looked for
  the effects of cannabinoids on mental health in nearly 40 years of research and
  their findings sounded grim: They wrote there was "scarce evidence" to support that
  cannabis improves mental health symptoms, leading publications like The Guardian
  to publish an article titled "Risks of cannabis use for mental health treatment
  outweigh benefits," and write that "the use of cannabis medicines to treat people
  with depression, anxiety, psychosis or other mental health issues cannot be justified
  because there is little evidence that they work or are safe." Time similarly concluded
  that "There''s ''Scarce Evidence'' That Cannabis Helps Mental Health Issues." This
  review reveals something many clinicians already knew: We dont have enough evidence
  to say that cannabis can treat mental health disorders. That doesnt necessarily
  mean weed doesnt help at all--it means we just don''t know. (And since risks of
  long-term cannabis use have been well-documented, of course they would outweigh
  benefits we are unaware of.) "The old adage that absence of evidence doesnt necessarily
  mean absence of effectiveness is true here," said Harry Sumnall, a professor of
  substance use at Liverpool John Moores Public Health Institute in the U.K., who
  was not involved in the review. Finding a lack of evidence isn''t a reason to throw
  in the towel. It should be motivation to conduct more rigorous studies, especially
  given the rise in use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products specifically for
  mental health, and the large swaths of the public deciding on their own that cannabis
  does treat these symptoms. Advertisement People are widely using cannabis--both
  THC and CBD--for their mental health. In 2017, a study found that people perceive
  cannabis to be an effective way to treat many conditions, and that some substituted
  cannabis for prescription medications like benzodiazepines (often given for anxiety)
  or antidepressants. In a 2018 study of over 2,400 CBD users, 62 percent said they
  used CBD for a medical condition--the top three being pain, anxiety, and depression.
  Just because your friend or your favorite Instagram influencer took CBD and it improved
  their anxiety better isnt enough to determine whether cannabis is effective for
  that purpose. This kind of evidence is called anecdotal and it can feel immensely
  powerful, especially if the experience happened to you. But thats not the way we
  decide that treatments are safe and effective. Even results from single studies
  might not be enough, especially when it comes to difficult areas like mental health.
  Consider the fact that researchers are still having debates about whether or not
  SSRIs are more effective than placebos for depression-- and those medications have
  been around for decades and have no issues surrounding legality that result in limits
  on research. This is one of the reasons scientists write reviews and meta-analyses,
  to try and combine findings from many studies. The authors of the new review searched
  for studies published between 1980 and 2018, including unpublished or ongoing studies,
  where medicinal cannabinoids were given to adults to treat depression, anxiety,
  attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette''s syndrome, post-traumatic stress
  disorder, or psychosis. In the end, they included 83 studies, 30 of which were randomized
  controlled trials--considered the gold standard of study design. Advertisement The
  results were mixed. "Our analyses and conclusions are limited by the small amount
  of available data, small study sizes, and heterogeneity of findings across studies,"
  the authors wrote. They found that pharmaceutical-grade THC made anxiety symptoms
  better, but only in people who had other medical conditions like chronic pain. This
  is an important caveat. If, for example, the primary outcome of a study was seeing
  if cannabis could help with chronic pain and a persons depression also improved,
  its hard to say whether the cannabis treated the depression, or if their pain got
  better and made them feel less depressed. In one study the review looked at, pharmaceutical
  cannabis made psychotic symptoms worse, while in others, pharmaceutical cannabis
  didnt show any significant effect on mental disorders, but was linked to increased
  side effects. The authors noted that there were very few randomized controlled trials
  for them to review that tested pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis. Another
  issue is that many people don''t take pharmaceutical or medicinal cannabis, they
  buy it recreationally--the studies can''t account for that variability either. "To
  make more confident conclusions we need more evidence; but at the moment there is
  not a lot that can support, guide or inform use of cannabinoids for mental disorders,"
  said Louisa Degenhardt, the deputy director at the National Drug and Alcohol Research
  Centre at The University of New South Wales in Sydney, and senior author on the
  review. Advertisement Kevin Hill, an addiction psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess
  Medical Center and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School,
  said that any clinician who treats patients who regularly use cannabis, either recreationally
  or medicinally, won''t be surprised at the mixed and sparse evidence the authors
  had to muddle through. "There is much more that we dont know about cannabis and
  CBD than we do know," Hill said. "With such an intense interest in cannabis and
  CBD as treatments for medical conditions including psychiatric disorders, it is
  disappointing that the rate and scale [of research] has not kept pace with the interest."
  Cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug, which is a barrier to research, but funding is a
  bigger one, Hill said. He thinks that states and companies profiting from cannabis
  and CBD should contribute to the science. "For the most part, they have not," Hill
  said. "A portion of profits from the sale of cannabis or CBD should be put toward
  finding the answers to important questions about efficacy and safety." It''s a process
  we know can work, even for something like CBD: Large-scale trials were how we found
  that CBD could be helpful for pediatric epilepsy conditions, and it''s now FDA-approved
  for that use. The reason why this all matters is because with mental health disorders,
  taking something thats not helping could eventually end up doing harm. If someone
  with depression takes CBD or medical cannabis daily and it doesn''t work (or makes
  it worse), they won''t improve. This could affect their overall quality of life,
  and their ability to work or be social. Advertisement Without more study, we could
  also be missing some of the basic biology around cannabis use. Earlier this year,
  a small study looked at the medical records of 25 people who used cannabis and found
  that they needed more anesthesia to remain sedated during certain medical procedures.
  When the authors tried to look at existing research to see if other clinicians had
  found the same thing, they discovered that their study was the first on that topic.
  "We did these huge literature searches and found nothing," Mark Twardowski, a doctor
  of osteopathic medicine, told VICE in April. "Really?" And many CBD products continue
  to be notoriously under regulated: In 2017, a study in JAMA found that only 30 percent
  of CBD products sold online were accurately labeled, and last year, a study in Forensic
  Science International found synthetic marijuana and dextromethorphan, an ingredient
  in cough syrup, in CBD vape liquid. "With millions of Americans using cannabis and
  CBD for myriad medical conditions, we should be conducting rigorously designed trials
  to see if cannabis and CBD actually are effective treatments for these conditions,"
  Hill said. The United States has the potential to lead the way in this work and
  we have not yet done so." Until more research is done, we should be wary of overblown
  claims around cannabis on both sides: that it does nothing, or that it''s a panacea--our
  gap in knowledge is too great for either. Follow Shayla Love on Twitter.'

  <p>&ldquo;There is much more that we don&rsquo;t know about cannabis and CBD than
  we do know,&rdquo; Hill said. &ldquo;With such an intense interest in cannabis and
  CBD as treatments for medical conditions including psychiatric disorders, it is
  disappointing that the rate and scale [of research] has not kept pace with the interest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug, which is a barrier to research, but funding is
  a bigger one, Hill said. He thinks that states and companies profiting from cannabis
  and CBD should contribute to the science. &ldquo;For the most part, they have not,&quot;
  Hill said. &quot;A portion of profits from the sale of cannabis or CBD should be
  put toward finding the answers to important questions about efficacy and safety.&quot;
  It''s a process we know can work, even for something like CBD: Large-scale trials
  were how we found that CBD could be helpful for pediatric epilepsy conditions, and
  it''s now <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzx5xz/fda-cbd-epidiolex">FDA-approved</a>
  for that use.</p>

  <p>The reason why this all matters is because with mental health disorders, taking
  something that&rsquo;s not helping could eventually end up doing harm. If someone
  with depression takes CBD or medical cannabis daily and it doesn''t work (or makes
  it worse), they won''t improve. This could affect their overall quality of life,
  and their ability to work or be social.</p>

  <p>Without more study, we could also be missing some of the basic biology around
  cannabis use. Earlier this year, a small study looked <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xz9mz/marijuana-users-might-need-more-anesthesia-in-medical-procedures">at
  the medical records</a> of 25 people who used cannabis and found that they needed
  more anesthesia to remain sedated during certain medical procedures. When the authors
  tried to look at existing research to see if other clinicians had found the same
  thing, they discovered that their study was the first on that topic. &ldquo;We did
  these huge literature searches and found nothing,&rdquo; Mark Twardowski, a doctor
  of osteopathic medicine, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xz9mz/marijuana-users-might-need-more-anesthesia-in-medical-procedures">told
  VICE</a> in April. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And many CBD products continue to be notoriously under regulated: In <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2661569">2017</a>,
  a study in <em>JAMA</em> found that only 30 percent of CBD products sold online
  were accurately labeled, and last year, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073818307047?via%3Dihub">study</a>
  in <em>Forensic Science International</em> found synthetic marijuana and dextromethorphan,
  an ingredient in cough syrup, in CBD vape liquid.</p>

  <p>&quot;With millions of Americans using cannabis and CBD for myriad medical conditions,
  we should be conducting rigorously designed trials to see if cannabis and CBD actually
  are effective treatments for these conditions,&quot; Hill said. The United States
  has the potential to lead the way in this work and we have not yet done so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Until more research is done, we should be wary of overblown claims around cannabis
  on both sides: that it does nothing, or that it''s a panacea&mdash;our gap in knowledge
  is too great for either.</p>
