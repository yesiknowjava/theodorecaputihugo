summary: Both LGBQ sexual identity and traumatic experiences in childhood are linked
  to a heightened risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, U.S. researchers say. To
  examine the relationships among teen sexual identity, childhood trauma and suicide
  risk, Clements-Nolle and colleagues enrolled approximately 5,000 students from 97
  high schools in Nevada to fill out questionnaires and answer questions about their
  sexual identity and exposure to adverse childhood experiences. Sexual identity was
  also linked to risk of suicidal thinking. Compared with heterosexual students with
  no ACEs, LGB and questioning students overall were three times more likely to report
  suicidal thoughts. Future research should evaluate whether interventions that support
  families with sexual minority youth and promote acceptance of adolescent sexual
  identity can also impact childhood victimization and household dysfunction, said
  Clements-Nolle.
