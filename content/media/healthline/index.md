summary: Getty Images Theres not enough scientific evidence to recommend cannabinoids
  for treating mental health conditions, a new study finds. Products with THC or CBD
  have been used in recent years as a way to self-medicate for certain mental health
  conditions. Consumer interest in using cannabis -- especially cannabidiol, or CBD
  -- to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions has increased
  sharply in the past few years. But the buzz around the mental health benefits of
  cannabinoids -- which includes cannabis and compounds like CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol,
  or THC -- has far outpaced the science, suggests a major new study . Researchers
  found that theres "inadequate evidence" available to suggest that cannabinoids can
  improve the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.
