  for treating mental health conditions, a new study finds. Products with THC or CBD
  have been used in recent years as a way to self-medicate for certain mental health
  conditions. Experts say people pursuing these options need to be careful and talk
  with their physician. Consumer interest in using cannabis -- especially cannabidiol,
  or CBD -- to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions has increased
  sharply in the past few years. This trend is driven in part by celebrities like
  Jennifer Aniston and Kristen Bell who are embracing CBD as a way to ease their symptoms
  of anxiety and depression. But the buzz around the mental health benefits of cannabinoids
  -- which includes cannabis and compounds like CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC
  -- has far outpaced the science, suggests a major new study . Researchers found
  that theres "inadequate evidence" available to suggest that cannabinoids can improve
  the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. "Based
  on this evidence, physicians should refrain from recommending cannabinoids to their
  patients for the treatment of mental health disorders," said Dr. Elina Drits, associate
  chair of psychiatry at Staten Island University Hospital in Staten Island, New York.
  Little evidence of THC and CBD for mental illness The researchers analysis included
  83 studies from 1980 through 2018 that looked at the use of cannabinoids to treat
  symptoms of mental health conditions. This included studies looking at the treatment
  of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit
  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), psychosis, and Tourette syndrome. Only 40 studies
  were randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for medical evidence. Most
  of these were small -- with fewer than 40 people each -- and ran for only 4 to 5
  weeks. Researchers did find that pharmaceutical THC -- with or without CBD -- reduced
  symptoms of anxiety in people with other medical conditions, compared to a nonactive
  placebo. However, Dr. Roopali Parikh, MD, a psychiatrist specializing in substance
  use disorder at Northwell Health Physician Partners Behavioral Health Group Practice
  in Manhasset, New York, pointed out that this evidence was of "low quality" and
  based on only seven studies with a total of 252 patients. There was no impact of
  pharmaceutical THC -- with or without CBD -- on depression symptoms. Most of the
  studies for anxiety and depression were for conditions like chronic, noncancer pain
  and multiple sclerosis, with anxiety or depression as a secondary symptom. THC is
  the compound in cannabis that causes the "high," while CBD is nonintoxicating. Cannabis
  and some cannabis products contain both of these compounds in differing amounts.
  CBD oil is also available with no or very low amounts of THC. The reduction in anxiety
  symptoms seen in some studies may have been because the pharmaceutical THC relieved
  the symptoms of the main medical condition, write the authors in the paper. As for
  PTSD, ADHD, psychosis, and Tourette syndrome, the researchers found no evidence
  that any type of cannabinoid improved the symptoms. In fact, one study suggests
  that pharmaceutical THC made the symptoms of psychosis worse. In addition, pharmaceutical
  THC (with or without CBD) was linked to a twofold increase in adverse events, said
  Parikh, who wasnt involved in the study. There was also an almost threefold increase
  in people dropping out of the studies due to negative side effects, she said. Other
  research has shown that theres a significant risk of negative side effects from
  cannabinoid use -- not just addiction, but also depression, anxiety, and psychosis.
