article: 'The #MeToo movement correlates with a sharp increase in internet searches
  related to sexual harassment and/or assault, per study data published in JAMA Internal
  Medicine. These data underscore the scope of sexual assault and harassment in the
  United States and reflect a need for structural-level interventions. Initiated by
  actress Alyssa Milano following public accusations of sexual misconduct against
  film producer Harvey Weinstein, the #MeToo movement encouraged survivors to share
  their stories on social media. Using raw search count estimates abstracted from
  Comscore, investigators monitored the volume of Google searches related to sexual
  assault and harassment in the months following the inception of #MeToo. Analyses
  were limited to searches originating in the United States and included all queries
  using the term "sexual" with "harassment" or "assault" between January 1, 2010 and
  June 15, 2018. Investigators also monitored the volume of searches regarding reporting
  of sexual misconduct and preventative training. Search volumes were reported as
  a ratio of all Google searches and were adjusted for changes in Google use over
  time. A counterfactual scenario was manufactured from predicted search volumes,
  thus providing "expected" query numbers for comparison. Sexual harassment and/or
  assault searches exceeded the expected volume by 86% (95% CI, 60%-117%; P <.001).
  Observed search volumes remained higher than expected for 8 months following the
  initiation of #MeToo. The number of relevant searches ranged from 40 to 54 million
  from October 15, 2017 to June 15, 2018. Searches related to reporting and preventive
  training were 30% (95% CI, 23%-39%; P <.001) and 51% (95% CI, 43%-60%; P <.001)
  higher than predicted between the beginning of #MeToo and the conclusion of the
  observation period. Continue Reading These study data indicate the power of grassroots
  campaigns in raising awareness about public health issues. The scope of #MeToo engagement
  on social media reflects a larger need for structure-level interventions from policy
  and health officials. In response to a clearly expressed public need, public health
  officials must expand the availability of resources for victims and invest in resources
  for preventative training. Reference Caputi TL, Nobles AL, Ayers JW. Internet searches
