article: 'Marijuana is more mainstream than its ever been. A growing number of states
  are legalizing it medicinally and recreationally; millions of people are vaping
  products that contain the compound THC (potentially to the detriment of their health);
  and non-psychoactive CBD is in everything from beauty products to seltzer water.
  This spring, Google searches for CBD exceeded searches for buzzy health topics like
  acupuncture, apple cider vinegar and meditation, according to a recent JAMA Network
  Open analysis. The problem: Even though many consumers turn to cannabis compounds,
  known as cannabinoids, to soothe issues like depression and anxiety, these substances
  dont seem to do much for mental health, according to a new research review published
  in the journal Lancet Psychiatry. A team of Australian researchers analyzed the
  results of 83 prior studies that looked at medicinal cannabinoids effects on mental
  health and neurological conditions, including depression, anxiety, Tourette syndrome,
  ADHD, PTSD and psychosis. While they found positive results here and there--some
  studies showed evidence that pharmaceutical CBD-THC could lessen symptoms of anxiety
  and certain symptoms of PTSD, while another found limited benefits from taking CBD
  for psychosis--overall, the literature provided "little evidence for the effectiveness
  of pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis for the treatment of any of these mental
  health disorders," the authors write. Even the positive results may not be directly
  linked to cannabis. The authors note that medicinal marijuana is often prescribed
  to patients for whom depression and anxiety are secondary conditions--that is, a
  chronic disease may be their "primary" diagnosis--which makes it hard to see how,
  exactly, the drug is helping. Marijuana could, for example, lessen chronic pain
  or nausea, which then leads to a reduction in mental health symptoms. Thats a good
  outcome, of course, but it doesnt necessarily mean that marijuana is directly treating
  depression or anxiety. Plus, many people arent using pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoids,
  and a body of research suggests non-medicinal cannabis use can worsen mental health
  symptoms, the authors note. The THC and CBD products available to most consumers
  are also notoriously under-regulated. Marijuanas legality varies from state to state,
  creating an active black and gray market, and most cannabis-derived products do
  not fall under the Food and Drug Administrations purview. (The FDA did approve an
  epilepsy treatment containing CBD last year.) Though the agency tries to step in
  when brands make unauthorized health claims or inaccurately label their products,
  as many do, its hard to keep pace with the number of products hitting the market.
  The review also exposed just how little research has been done on cannabinoids and
  mental health. The researchers struggled to find studies specifically looking at
  CBD and depression and anxiety, for example, even though many people use it to self-treat
  that condition. While some people may see a positive effect--either placebo or otherwise--after
  using cannabinoids, the evidence to support their therapeutic use for mental health
  problems just isnt there yet, as the latest review shows. Get our Health Newsletter.
