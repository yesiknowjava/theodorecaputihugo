article: 'A new study found 25% of gay, lesbian and bi teens reporting they attempted
  suicide in the last year. Gay Teens Are Four Times More Likely To Attempt Suicide
  Suicide has long been an issue for LBGT youth, but a new study finds that theyre
  four times as likely to try to take their own lives than their hetero peers. Researcher
  from San Diego State University interviewed 16,000 young people in 2015, asking
  them about mental health and sexuality. The results, published in JAMA, underscores
  the crisis in LGBT youth suicide: 25% of the teens who identified as gay, lesbian,
  bisexual or questioning reported a suicide attempt in the last year, as compared
  to just 6% of heterosexuals. A full 40% of gay/bi youth had "seriously considered"
  suicide, while 35% actually made plans. (Trans and gender-nonconforming youth were
  not incorporated into this study.) "There have been some indications that LGBQ youth
  face increased suicide risks, yet many believed the jury was still out," wrote study
  author John Ayers of SDSUs School of Public Health. "Our study yields a clear verdict:
  LGBQ youth face staggeringly high suicide risks." The study did not explore the
  causes of suicidal ideation among queer youth, but LGBT kids are more likely to
  be subjected to a host of negative influences, including bullying, rejection by
  family, conversion therapy and homelessness. Depression among LGBT people has been
  shown to increase significantly after new laws that discriminate against gay people
  are passed. Researchers out of the University of Nevada recently reported that gay,
  lesbian, bisexual and questioning youth who reported at least one adverse childhood
  experience ((ACE) were seven times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual
  students. More than half of LGB students reported at least two ACEs, which raises
  their odds of attempting suicide to 13 times that of their straight peers. "It is
  imperative that we identify adolescent populations at greatest risk to guide our
  prevention efforts," author Kristen Clements-Nolle told Reuters. If you or someone
