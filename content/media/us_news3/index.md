summary: '"Charlie Sheen''s disclosure is potentially the most significant domestic
  HIV prevention event in the last decade," said study author John Ayers, a research
  professor with the university''s Graduate School of Public Health. But the number
  of stories grew by 265 percent on the day of Sheen''s disclosure, to around 25 per
  1,000, the researchers found. Sheen''s disclosure could potentially have a more
  pronounced effect," Leas added. That is why announcements like this result in people
  not only googling Charlie Sheen but googling information about HIV prevention and
  testing." More informationFor more about HIV prevention, visit the U.S. Centers
