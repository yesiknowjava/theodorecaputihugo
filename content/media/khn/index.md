  Claim? Stand Up For Your Rights While legislation is critical in preventing health
  plan barriers, consumers also play a role. By knowing their rights, appealing denials,
  and fighting back, patients can stand up for themselves. But first they need to
  know that is an option. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation report looked at data
  on claim denials and appeals from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
  Among other findings, the report showed that consumers rarely appeal claims that
  have been denied. In 2017, 121 major health insurance issuers denied a total of
  more than 42 million claims. Consumers appealed less than 200,000 (0.05%) of these
  denials. Although consumers have the right to bypass their insurers internal appeals
  process and go directly to an external review, this happens in fewer than 1 in 11,000
  denied claims (0.009%). (Liz Helms, 5/17) The Hill: Private Equity Is A Driving
  Force Behind Devious Surprise Billing Surprise medical bills are in the news almost
  daily. Last Thursday, the White House called for legislation to protect patients
  from getting surprise doctor bills when they are rushed to the emergency room and
  receive care from doctors not covered by insurance at an in-network hospital. The
  financial burden on patients can be substantial -- these doctor charges can amount
  to hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Whats behind this explosion of outrageous
  charges and surprise medical bills? Physicians groups, it turns out, can opt out
  of a contract with insurers even if the hospital has such a contract. The doctors
  are then free to charge patients, who desperately need care, however much they want.
  (Eileen Appelbaum, 5/16) The New York Times: ''Medicare For All Could Kill Two Million
  Jobs, And Thats O.K. As calls for radical health reform grow louder, many on the
  right, in the center and in the health care industry are arguing that proposals
  like "Medicare for all" would cause economic ruin, decimating a sector that represents
  nearly 20 percent of our economy. While exploring a presidential run, the former
  Starbucks chief Howard Schultz called Medicare for all "not American," adding, "What
  industry are we going to abolish next -- the coffee industry?" He said that it would
  "wipe out the insurance industry." (Elisabeth Rosenthal, 5/16) The Hill: It''s Time
  To Retire Primate Experiments In 2015, after extensive public and congressional
  pressure, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) cut funding for experiments on
  chimpanzees and began retiring them to sanctuary. Now, in a historic move, Congress
  is asking the NIH to begin to do the same for the thousands of other primates in
  its taxpayer-funded laboratories, and its about time. Last year, approximately 7,000
  baboons, marmosets, macaques and other primates were confined and experimented on
  by the NIH. Unfortunately, primate research at the NIH is growing despite policies
  requiring the reduction and replacement of animal testing. (Stacy Lopresti-Goodman,
  5/16) JAMA: The Need For Federal Regulation Of Marijuana Marketing A national for-profit
  marijuana industry is expanding substantially in the United States. Thirty-three
  states have legalized medical marijuana, 10 of which (where 1 in 4 individuals reside)
  have also legalized recreational marijuana. Sales of marijuana are projected to
  increase from $8.5 billion to $75 billion by 2030, rivaling current tobacco sales
  ($125 billion). The initial marijuana marketplace was limited to a few states, but
  emerging brands have developed sophisticated national marketing campaigns that could
  potentially have an effect across state lines. This marketplace expansion, along
  with questionable marketing practices, introduces a need for federal action. (John
  W. Ayers, Theodore Caputi and Eric C. Leas, 5/16) New England Journal of Medicine:
  Big Data And The Intelligence Community -- Lessons For Health Care Health care is
  lagging behind other industries in its approaches to data science, in part because
  it is relatively new to big data. By learning from the intelligence community, the
  health sector can accelerate progress and capitalize on existing innovations. (Kevin
  Vigilante, Steve Escaravage and Mike McConnell, 5/16) Kansas City Star: Missouri
  Punishes The Poor By Underfunding Public Defenders Underfunding the public defender
  is politically popular because its hard to find much sympathy for people who get
  arrested. But a fair criminal justice system does more than prosecute the guilty.
  It also protects the innocent, which means all of us. (5/15) This is part of the
