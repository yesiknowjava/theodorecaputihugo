summary: HIV-positive actor Charlie Sheen has helped increase awareness and testing
  of the condition according to two new U.S. studies looking into what researchers
  have dubbed the "Charlie Sheen effect." In a more recent follow-up study, also by
  Prof Ayers, the team investigated whether internet search queries, which they based
  on Google Trends data on searches with "test," "tests," or "testing" and "HIV,"
  showed a link with an increase in HIV testing. "In absolute terms, it's hard to
  appreciate the magnitude of Sheen's disclosure," commented study co-author Benjamin
  Althouse, "However, when we compared Sheen's disclosure to other traditional awareness
  campaigns the 'Charlie Sheen effect' is astonishing." One of the most high-profile
  and longest-running of these traditional awareness campaigns is World AIDS Day,
  with OraQuick sales following Sheen's announcement nearly eight times greater than
  sales around the well-known event. However, he also added that the Charlie Sheen
  effect may still be going.
