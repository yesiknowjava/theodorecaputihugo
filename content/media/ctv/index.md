article: HIV-positive actor Charlie Sheen has helped increase awareness and testing
  of the condition according to two new U.S. studies looking into what researchers
  have dubbed the "Charlie Sheen effect." The first study, led by San Diego State
  University Graduate School of Public Health research professor John W. Ayers, found
  that millions of online search queries for HIV prevention and testing were carried
  out after the actor made the announcement that he is HIV-positive on NBC's "Today
  Show" on Nov. 17, 2015. In a more recent follow-up study, also by Prof Ayers, the
  team investigated whether internet search queries, which they based on Google Trends
  data on searches with "test," "tests," or "testing" and "HIV," showed a link with
  an increase in HIV testing. The researchers collected data on sales of OraQuick,
  the only rapid at-home HIV test kit available in the United States, and found that
  in the same week Sheen made his TV appearance, sales in OraQuick nearly doubled,
  reaching an all-time high. Sales continued to remain significantly higher than usual
  for the following three weeks, with 8,225 more sales than expected. "In absolute
  terms, it's hard to appreciate the magnitude of Sheen's disclosure," commented study
  co-author Benjamin Althouse, "However, when we compared Sheen's disclosure to other
  traditional awareness campaigns the 'Charlie Sheen effect' is astonishing." One
  of the most high-profile and longest-running of these traditional awareness campaigns
  is World AIDS Day, with OraQuick sales following Sheen's announcement nearly eight
  times greater than sales around the well-known event. Study co-author Mark Dredze,
  a Johns Hopkins University computer scientist, added that "public health must ready
  itself for the next Sheen-like event by embracing big media data for decision making."
  However, he also added that the Charlie Sheen effect may still be going. "Our findings
  build on earlier studies that suggest empathy is easier to motivate others when
  the empathy is targeted toward an individual versus a group," explained co-author
  Jon-Patrick Allem, research scientist with the University of Southern California
  Keck School of Medicine. "It is easy to imagine that a single individual, like Sheen,
  disclosing his HIV status may be more compelling and motivating for people than
  an unnamed mass of individuals or a lecture from public health leaders." The findings
  can be found published online in the journal Prevention Science.
