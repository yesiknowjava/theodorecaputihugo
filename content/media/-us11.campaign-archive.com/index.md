article: 'Sponsored by NIH, Gates Foundation launch effort to bring genetic cures
  to worlds poor The NIH and the Gates Foundation are investing at least $200 million
  over the next four years toward developing gene therapies for sickle cell disease
  and HIV. Unlike many other attempts at such therapies, the focus will be to ensure
  that the treatments are affordable and available to resource-poor countries, especially
  in Africa. The move comes amid growing concern that new treatments that alter the
  underlying genetics of a disease will be prohibitively expensive -- a gene therapy
  for a rare form of blindness, for instance, costs around $425,000 per eye. The initiative
  will aim to test any potential cures in the U.S. and countries in sub-Saharan Africa
  in the next seven to 10 years, and to then make such therapies available in the
  hardest-hit areas. "We aim to go big or go home," NIH Director Francis Collins said
  in a statement. FDA wants stronger warning on breast implants about risks The FDA
  wants women getting breast implants to receive stronger warnings and more details
  about the risks and complications associated with the procedure. The agency issued
  a draft guidance document calling on breast implant makers to include a boxed warning
  as well as a checklist that patients can use to better understand the risks, including
  pain and scarring. The FDA is also recommending that labels include information
  about whats in the implants. The new guidance comes after reports in recent months
  linking certain kinds of implants with illnesses in women with the products. In
  July, the FDA asked Allergan to recall a type of its textured breast implants after
  several hundred women who received the implants developed a rare type of lymphoma.
  The guidance is now subject to a 60-day public comment period before being finalized.
  Inside STAT: A toxic weed fuels a cancer-drug gold rush -- and a quandary The drug
  was still experimental, but already it was something of a celebrity. For patients
  with Gorlin syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, the idea that a gel might reduce
  the skin cancer surgeries they needed was so seductive it hardly seemed real. In
  fact, it nearly hadnt been. The medicine had come from an unlikely place -- the
  wild cow cabbage patches around Manti-La Sal National Forest -- on an even unlikelier
  assumption: that this botanical Gold Rush would yield a treatment for a whole litany
  of cancers. In the second half of "The Medicine Hunters," STATs Eric Boodman brings
  you inside both that drug-finding quest -- involving machetes, mowers, and some
  of the biggest pharma companies in the world -- as well as the quest of Gorlin patients
  to reduce these medications'' financial toxicity. Read the story here. Google searches
  for CBD have skyrocketed in recent years CBD products are widely advertised as a
  treatment for a plethora of ailments, and a new study finds that Google searches
  for such items have also skyrocketed recently. Looking at data between January 2004
  and April 2019, scientists found that although searches for CBD products were relatively
  stable during the first decade of the study period, they increased by 126% in 2017
  compared to 2016, and 160% in 2018 compared to the previous year. There were more
  than 6 million searches last April, which outnumbered searches for other health
  terms including acupuncture and meditation. At the same time, a new report outlines
  the global use of different drugs -- including cannabis -- and finds that in Canada
  and some U.S. states, CBD products are used to treat medical conditions "in the
  absence of evidence of their effectiveness and safety." A new test could identify
  tuberculosis in less than an hour Tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease
  globally, but quickly detecting it -- and distinguishing it from other respiratory
  infections with similar symptoms -- has remained a challenge. A new paper describes
  a test capable of diagnosing TB in less than an hour. Using machine learning techniques
  to sift through data from 317 patients, the scientists identified four blood proteins
  that are unique to tuberculosis to develop their test. The accuracy of the test
  improved when they added a fifth marker that picked up on specific proteins produced
  in response to toxins expressed by TB. Overall, the new test was correctly able
  to identify those with TB 86% of the time, and was correctly able to rule out disease
  in non-TB infected people 69% of the time, which aligns with the WHOs requirements
  for a new TB test. Nature journals gets a new look The scientific journal Nature
  and many of its affiliate journals -- where your Morning Rounds writer previously
  worked -- are getting a makeover. Specifically, many of the Nature journals now
  have a new "digital friendly" font and logo. This isnt the first time for such an
  update: In an article, Kelly Krause, one of Natures creative directors, explains
  that ornate Victorian embellishments graced the journal when it was founded in 1869,
  while it opted for a more minimalistic look in the 1960s. For the newest change,
  the team took into account how science often uses standalone letters to represent
  concepts -- such as a -- and how the new typeface needed to account for people accessing
  materials on smaller, mobile devices. The team ultimately settled on a typeface
  theyre calling Harding -- named for the late neurologist Anita Harding. What to
  read around the web today Is the stethoscope dying? High-tech rivals pose a threat.

  colon cancer study. STAT Plus The woman who founded industrial medicine. Scientific
