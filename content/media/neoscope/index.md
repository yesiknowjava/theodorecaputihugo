  Adult diapers. All to your door in an anonymous box, and without the need to avert
  your gaze from the cashier. Apparently, marijuana is no exception -- Americans are
  buying weed online in droves. This news comes courtesy of a study published today
  in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. It marks the first time anyone has
  analyzed online marijuana sales by looking at internet searches and the resulting
  links. For their study into Americans online pot-purchasing behavior, the research
  team started -- where else?-- with Google. Specifically, they looked at searches
  on the platform between January 2005 and June 2017, excluding those from the U.S.s
  six least-populated states. Advertisement Advertisement First, they isolated all
  the searches including terms such as "marijuana," and "weed" in combination with
  "buy," "shop," or "order." From that list, they eliminated searches that were clearly
  unrelated or off-topic, such as "order weed killer." This left them with 12 terms
  tied to the thing they actually wanted: buying marijuana through the internet. Next,
  they looked at how often people searched those terms each month. They found that,
  in the 12 years they studied, searches tied to buying weed online increased by 199
  percent relative to all searches on the internet. In June 2017, the numbers soared
  as *high* as 2.4 million in a single month. The searches werent restricted to particular
  parts of the country -- all but two states the researchers analyzed saw a growing
  number of searches each month. Not content to simply track search totals, the intrepid
  team also wanted to know where their list of terms would take them online. You know,
  for research. Advertisement Advertisement In July 2017, they typed each of their
  pre-determined keywords into Google, hit "search," and analyzed the first two pages
  worth of links. Of those links, 41 percent were to retailers offering mail-order
  marijuana. For two-thirds of the searches, the very first link led to such a retailer.
  Their conclusion: People arent just searching for weed online. Theyre finding it.
  This wouldnt be a problem if buying weed were the same as, say, buying shoes or
  electronics. Though nine states and Washington D.C. now permit recreational marijuana
  use, none permit its sale online. Buying online may be more convenient, but there
  are good reasons why its not allowed. When people buy online, states might miss
  out on the major financial benefit of legalizing recreational marijuana: taxes.
  Advertisement Advertisement Even more importantly, its harder to regulate who is
  buying the weed. In states where marijuana is legal, buyers must be 21 or older,
  and its far easier for those below that limit to fake their ages online than in
  person. The studys authors noted in a press release that public health leaders must
  intervene to prevent these sales, perhaps by convincing internet service providers
  (ISPs) to remove mail-order weed retailers from search engines. Of course, that
  wouldnt stop teenagers from purchasing weed if they were really determined to get
  it. But as U.S. states relax their marijuana laws, the nation needs to take precautions
  to keep the drug out of the hands of people who shouldnt have it. Addressing mail-order
  marijuana seems like a pretty good place to start. As a Futurism reader, we invite
