summary: 'Pictured: last monthCharlie Sheen saved lives by revealing that he is HIV
  positive, a study claims. Last year, researchers at San Diego State University published
  a study showing Sheen''s TV appearance sparked millions of online searches for HIV
  prevention and testing. The week of Sheen''s disclosure coincided with a near doubling
  in OraQuick sales, which reached an all-time high. ''In absolute terms, it''s hard
  to appreciate the magnitude of Sheen''s disclosure,'' added study coauthor Benjamin
  Althouse, research scientist with the Institute of Disease Modeling. ''However,
  when we compared Sheen''s disclosure to other traditional awareness campaigns the
  "Charlie Sheen effect" is astonishing.'''
