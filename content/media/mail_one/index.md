article: 'Researchers at San Diego State University have published a study showing
  Sheen''s TV appearance sparked an uptick with rates of people getting at-home HIV
  tests - reaching a record high. Pictured: last month Charlie Sheen saved lives by
  revealing that he is HIV positive, a study claims. On November 17, 2015, the actor
  publicly disclosed his HIV status on NBC''s Today Show. Last year, researchers at
  San Diego State University published a study showing Sheen''s TV appearance sparked
  millions of online searches for HIV prevention and testing. Now, they have taken
  that research a step further, showing there was also an uptick with rates of people
  getting at-home rapid HIV tests - reaching a record high. The team collected data
  on weekly sales of OraQuick, the only rapid in-home HIV test kit available in the
  United States, to investigate whether Internet queries (based on Google Trends data
  on searches with ''test,'' ''tests,'' or ''testing'' and ''HIV'') could be correlated
  with any uptick in HIV testing. ''Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world
  estimation of the "Charlie Sheen effect" on HIV prevention and contrast that effect
  with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,'' said study coauthor
  Eric Leas. The week of Sheen''s disclosure coincided with a near doubling in OraQuick
  sales, which reached an all-time high. Sales remained significantly higher for the
  following three weeks, with 8,225 more sales than expected. ''In absolute terms,
  it''s hard to appreciate the magnitude of Sheen''s disclosure,'' added study coauthor
  Benjamin Althouse, research scientist with the Institute of Disease Modeling. ''However,
  when we compared Sheen''s disclosure to other traditional awareness campaigns the
  "Charlie Sheen effect" is astonishing.'' OraQuick sales in the time period around
  Sheen''s disclosure were nearly eight times greater than sales around World Aids
  Day, one of the most well-known and longest-running HIV prevention awareness events.

  which reached an all-time high. Sales remained significantly higher for the following
  three weeks, with 8,225 more sales than expected. Pictured: the chart from the study
  of OraQuick sales The team''s most significant takeaway, however, is that these
  findings reinforce their past analyses of Google search data. Using Internet searches
  alone the team was able to predict HIV testing sales within seven percent for any
  given weeks. ''Public health leaders are often cautious, choosing to wait for traditional
  data instead of taking reasonable action in response to novel data, like Internet
  searches,'' Ayers said. ''Our findings underscore the value of big media data for
  yielding rapid intelligence to make public health actionable and more responsive
  to the public it serves.'' Study coauthor Mark Dredze, a Johns Hopkins University
  computer scientist, added that ''public health must ready itself for the next Sheen-like
  event by embracing big media data for decision making.'' said. Still, it may be
  the window has not fully closed on the Charlie Sheen effect, he said. ''Our findings
  build on earlier studies that suggest empathy is easier to motivate others when
  the empathy is targeted toward an individual versus a group'' said coauthor Jon-Patrick
  Allem, research scientist with the University of Southern California Keck School
  of Medicine. ''It is easy to imagine that a single individual, like Sheen, disclosing
  his HIV status may be more compelling and motivating for people than an unnamed
  mass of individuals or a lecture from public health leaders.'' Since his diagnosis,
  Sheen has been vocal about treatment options and side effects. At first, the star
  started on anti-retroviral therapy, the standard treatment for HIV. But in early
  2016, months after his public announcement, he joined a Phase III clinical trial
  for an experimental weekly injection called PRO-140. From day one he has gushed
  about its effects. On numerous occasions, he has told Daily Mail Online that he
  felt an emotional and physical transformation when he switched from ''that cocktail
  of drugs'' to his weekly treatment. And earlier this month he addressed why he was
  motivated to try an unapproved treatment - revealing his old HIV medication left
  him with ''borderline dementia''. Speaking to Daily Mail Online, Sheen said he did
  not have symptoms of dementia until he started taking his first regime of drugs
  to suppress his HIV. But those symptoms disappeared after he joined the PRO-140
  trial. His words came as the drug, which ended its successful phase III clinical
  trial early this year, is now being assessed for FDA approval. Sheen told the Mail
  he ''is feeling fantastic now!'''
