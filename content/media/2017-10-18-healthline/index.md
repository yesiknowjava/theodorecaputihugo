article: Federal regulators are studying these products that heat tobacco rather than
  burn it. Manufacturers hope they can overtake e-cigarettes. Share on Pinterest A
  new tobacco product thats already popular overseas could overtake e-cigarettes in
  the United States. New research from San Diego State University predicts that "heat-not-burn"
  tobacco products could soon be flooding American markets. The authors warn that
  policymakers, anti-tobacco advocates, and the healthcare community need to be prepared
  for action when the products arrive. Heat-not-burn tobacco products are the latest
  iteration of electronic smoking. Unlike e-cigarettes and vaporizers, they dont rely
  on a nicotine-infused liquid ("e-juice"). Instead, they use actual tobacco thats
  heated to roughly 570degF (299degC) using a battery-powered heating element. The
  tobacco is kept below the temperature of combustion, creating an inhalable aerosol.
  Heat-not-burn products are currently unavailable in the United States. They are
  for sale in a series of test markets in Europe and Asia. The most robust market
  is in Japan, where theyve been available since 2014. Product under study in the
  U.S. An evaluation of Philip Morris Internationals IQOS, a heat-not-burn technology,
  is currently under way by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United
  States. However, the product must undergo rigorous review because its being brought
  to market as a " modified risk tobacco product ." Modified risk tobacco product
  (MRTP) is a designation given by the FDA that refers to "tobacco products that are
  sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease
  associated with commercially marketed tobacco products." To achieve this designation,
  an applicant must demonstrate that the product has the ability to "significantly
  reduce harm" and disease related to tobacco. It must also benefit overall health
  on a population level, accounting for individuals who dont use tobacco products.
  Whether or not the IQOS and other heat-not-burn products can meet this designation
  remains to be seen. The FDA will make their ruling on the product within the next
  two months. If approved, the IQOS would be the first device to carry an MRTP designation.
  Searching for answers Currently, theres a lack of information on heat-not-burn tobacco
  products. The study authors note that there are less than 30 studies in the medical
  literature on these devices. On account of this, they turned to nontraditional data,
  including Google search information to analyze growing interest in the product.
  "[Google searches] are probably a stronger indicator of interest than if you just
  asked on a survey," John Ayers, a lead study author and a research professor at
  San Diego State, told Healthline. "Here were observing people seeking out information
  on the product, potentially trying to buy the product." Ayers said looking at this
  kind of data before has previously been able to predict the rise of e-cigarettes,
  as well as other things such as movie and album sales. What theyve seen so far of
  heat-not-burn tobacco products gives every indication that they could be a phenomenon,
  dwarfing even e-cigarettes. According to the study, there are now about 6 to 7 million
  "heat-not-burn" Google searches in Japan each month. Two years ago, almost no one
  was searching for them online. "That growth rate eclipses anything else weve ever
  seen for any other tobacco product, including electronic cigarettes," said Ayers.
  Researchers said that given these trends, the potential for massive growth both
  in the United States and around the globe is likely. Why the product is popular
  The appeal of the product is manifold. It offers a novel new form of nicotine consumption
  that could be of interest to e-cigarette smokers. It also offers a distinct "throat-hit,"
  a physical sensation of smoking cigarettes, thats sometimes lacking in other vaporizers
  or e-cigarette models. However, the health implications of heat-not-burn products
  are still not well understood. "There are all these public health questions like
  'Can it be a cessation device? We dont know," said Ayers. "What are the harms of
  it? What are the harms of being exposed to the vapor? We dont know that." E-cigarettes,
  which have already been on the market for years, are still problematic. Researchers
  have yet to reach a conclusion on their overall effects on public health. While
  recent studies indicate that e-cigarettes are most likely a healthier option than
  traditional smoking, not all experts agree. The role of e-cigarettes as potential
  cessation devices is still debated. The allure of e-cigarettes for teens, especially
  on account of sweet, fruit, and candy flavored vaping liquids also remains particularly
  contentious.

  contentious</a>.</p>

  <p>Instead of trying to answer the myriad of health questions surrounding heat-not-burn
  tobacco, Ayers instead says his study is &ldquo;a call to action.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start studying it now and creating infrastructure to respond
  now,&rdquo; said Ayers. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, then Phillip Morris is going to
  be setting the agenda when it comes to this product.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Advocacy groups in the United States do seem to be aware of the potentially imminent
  arrival of heat-not-burn tobacco.</p>

  <p>Erika Sward, a spokesperson for the American Lung Association, told Healthline
  that they&rsquo;ve been following the development of these products since they came
  on the market in Japan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We assumed it was a matter of time before Philip Morris International
  would want to introduce the product into the U.S.,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>While Sward wouldn&rsquo;t give a direct comment on the potential of the device
  (for harm or good), owing to a lack of research thus far, she says that they&rsquo;re
  following the FDA review closely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We look forward to a very thorough review of the data that we have, that
  the public has, as well as FDA doing a very careful review of how this product may
  impact the public health and whether or not ultimately it is appropriate to allow
  the product to be sold here in the states,&rdquo; said Sward.</p>'
