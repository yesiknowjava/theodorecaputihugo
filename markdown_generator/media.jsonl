Worldwide, there were 36.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS in 2015--the year Sheen made his announcement. But one epidemiologist notes that Sheen's disclosure may have had a hugely positive effect on HIV awareness. Last year, Dr. John W. Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at San Diego State University, was studying Google searches and news articles during the period around Sheen's announcement. His study, which appeared in JAMA Internal Medicine noted, unsurprisingly, that the number of searches and news stories involving the terms\"HIV\" showed a dramatic uptick in the days following Sheen's announcement. That's hardly a shock. Sheen's admission that he was HIV-positive was covered extensively. But there was another interesting uptick in the HIV-related search terms. Not only did people search more for \"HIV,\" people also searched more for \"HIV\" and \"symptoms,\" \"signs of,\" and \"testing.\" Ayers hypothesized that Sheen's disclosure might actually have had a positive effect on HIV awareness, encouraging people to get tested themselves. In an email to New York Magazine, Ayers was unequivocal: \"Sheens disclosure is the most significant domestic HIV-prevention event in the last decade, even though it was unplanned and was not framed as a public-health event.\" Now, there's even more reason to think that Sheen's disclosure had a positive effect. Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in Prevention Science. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says \"OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheens disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... \" Just look at the jump in sales. This graph comes directly from the study: The first graph shows the remarkable jump in sales right around Sheen's disclosure. The second graph compares the effect of Sheen's disclosure on OraQuick sales with the effect of World AIDS Day. The study notes that \"excess OraQuick sales following Sheens disclosure were equivalent to about 7 World Aids Days.\" What's OraQuick? OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently available, according to the CDC, who write \"The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 infected people may test false-negative with this test.\" Getting tested regularly for HIV and other STIs is hugely important. According to the CDC, of the 850,000-950,000 individuals living with HIV in the United States, \"one fourth of individuals living with HIV are unaware that they have the virus.\" And people who are unaware that they have HIV present a twofold problem. First, those who do not know they are HIV positive do not seek treatment--and anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to dramatically increase the life expectancy of HIV patients. In terms of the success of this therapy, also known as the AIDS \"cocktail,\" early detection is key. According to Medwiser, HIV patients who are treated early will live an average of 11 years longer. Second, those who are unaware of their status cannot take steps to ensure that they do not pass the virus on to others, compounding the scourge of the epidemic. So go get tested.

So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?\" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

Worldwide, there were 36.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS in 2015--the year Sheen made his announcement. But one epidemiologist notes that Sheen's disclosure may have had a hugely positive effect on HIV awareness. Last year, Dr. John W. Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at San Diego State University, was studying Google searches and news articles during the period around Sheen's announcement. His study, which appeared in JAMA Internal Medicine noted, unsurprisingly, that the number of searches and news stories involving the terms\"HIV\" showed a dramatic uptick in the days following Sheen's announcement. That's hardly a shock. Sheen's admission that he was HIV-positive was covered extensively. But there was another interesting uptick in the HIV-related search terms. Not only did people search more for \"HIV,\" people also searched more for \"HIV\" and \"symptoms,\" \"signs of,\" and \"testing.\" Ayers hypothesized that Sheen's disclosure might actually have had a positive effect on HIV awareness, encouraging people to get tested themselves. In an email to New York Magazine, Ayers was unequivocal: \"Sheens disclosure is the most significant domestic HIV-prevention event in the last decade, even though it was unplanned and was not framed as a public-health event.\" Now, there's even more reason to think that Sheen's disclosure had a positive effect. Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in Prevention Science. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says \"OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheens disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... \" Just look at the jump in sales. This graph comes directly from the study: The first graph shows the remarkable jump in sales right around Sheen's disclosure. The second graph compares the effect of Sheen's disclosure on OraQuick sales with the effect of World AIDS Day. The study notes that \"excess OraQuick sales following Sheens disclosure were equivalent to about 7 World Aids Days.\" What's OraQuick? OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently available, according to the CDC, who write \"The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 infected people may test false-negative with this test.\" Getting tested regularly for HIV and other STIs is hugely important. According to the CDC, of the 850,000-950,000 individuals living with HIV in the United States, \"one fourth of individuals living with HIV are unaware that they have the virus.\" And people who are unaware that they have HIV present a twofold problem. First, those who do not know they are HIV positive do not seek treatment--and anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to dramatically increase the life expectancy of HIV patients. In terms of the success of this therapy, also known as the AIDS \"cocktail,\" early detection is key. According to Medwiser, HIV patients who are treated early will live an average of 11 years longer. Second, those who are unaware of their status cannot take steps to ensure that they do not pass the virus on to others, compounding the scourge of the epidemic. So go get tested.

A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for HIV is \"a good thing, regardless of who he is.\" Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this article.

The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for HIV is \"a good thing, regardless of who he is.\" Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this article.

But one epidemiologist notes that Sheen's disclosure may have had a hugely positive effect on HIV awareness. Last year, Dr. John W. Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at San Diego State University, was studying Google searches and news articles during the period around Sheen's announcement. His study, which appeared in JAMA Internal Medicine noted, unsurprisingly, that the number of searches and news stories involving the terms\"HIV\" showed a dramatic uptick in the days following Sheen's announcement. That's hardly a shock. Sheen's admission that he was HIV-positive was covered extensively. But there was another interesting uptick in the HIV-related search terms.

Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in Prevention Science. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says \"OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheens disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... \" Just look at the jump in sales. This graph comes directly from the study: The first graph shows the remarkable jump in sales right around Sheen's disclosure. The second graph compares the effect of Sheen's disclosure on OraQuick sales with the effect of World AIDS Day. The study notes that \"excess OraQuick sales following Sheens disclosure were equivalent to about 7 World Aids Days.\" What's OraQuick? OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently available, according to the CDC, who write \"The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 infected people may test false-negative with this test.\" Getting tested regularly for HIV and other STIs is hugely important. According to the CDC, of the 850,000-950,000 individuals living with HIV in the United States, \"one fourth of individuals living with HIV are unaware that they have the virus.\" And people who are unaware that they have HIV present a twofold problem. First, those who do not know they are HIV positive do not seek treatment--and anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to dramatically increase the life expectancy of HIV patients. In terms of the success of this therapy, also known as the AIDS \"cocktail,\" early detection is key. According to Medwiser, HIV patients who are treated early will live an average of 11 years longer. Second, those who are unaware of their status cannot take steps to ensure that they do not pass the virus on to others, compounding the scourge of the epidemic. So go get tested.

Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist. Q: How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long did it last? A: As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals develop their gender identity. Its something that may evolve throughout a persons lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation and class. For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the \"pronoun check\" posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take. My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used \"they/them\" pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using \"he\" pronouns and physically transitioning. I made this decision with the understanding that I wasnt transitioning because I identified as a \"man\" per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, Ive passed as male about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!) When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say \"non-binary,\" and that my pronouns are \"he or they -- either as fine.\" I am leaning into presenting as femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine, because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important. Q: Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why? A: Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didnt initially know what being transgender meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget. Luckily, there is a lot of information and help available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities. For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help people navigate the name and gender marker change process. One side effect that I didnt entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, \"Will people here be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?\" As a white and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership -- and that of their successors in our movements -- must be recognized. Q: Did you have, or do you currently have, any regrets about transitioning? A: What I think this question is getting at is, \"How do you know youre sure?\" This was a question that I asked myself many times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes to my body. My answer to that is: I didnt truly know it was right until after I did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, \"Why on earth would you do something so permanent if you werent sure?\" But It took a leap of faith. And, as someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesnt feel right, you know. It is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to stop your physical transition, you dont need to think of it as \"de-transitioning.\" The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots. Q: How has transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem and mental health? A: Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient. Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power of our community. Q: What advice would you give to other people who want to follow the path you did? A: Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there are no rules! You dont have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition. Youre in the drivers seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms you will occupy it.

Following the Weinstein scandal, researchers from Harvard Medical School and UC San Diego took a look at Google search rates for sexual harassment and sexual assault before and after Milano's #MeToo tweet.

Just look at what happened after Charlie Sheen's HIV disclosure two years ago, said John Ayers , a research professor at San Diego State University. Sales of in-home HIV testing kits reached record highs around the same time the actor announced that he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2015, according to a study published in the journal Prevention Science on Thursday. Ayers was a co-author of the study. About the same time, \"in record numbers, people were going online, seeking out information on what the signs of HIV are, on how to find and appropriately prevent HIV with devices such as condoms and also how to get tested,'\" Ayers said. \"We've seen this ... many times over.\" For the new study, Ayers and his co-authors monitored weekly sales of OraQuick, the only FDA-approved at-home oral HIV testing kit available in the United States, from 2014 to 2016. The researchers found that there were 8,225 more sales than they expected the week of Sheen's HIV status announcement. Elevated sales continued for four weeks after Sheen's disclosure. The findings show a correlation, not a direct causation. Yet in a previous study, Ayers and his colleagues also found that Google searches for HIV testing and related topics also spiked after Sheen's announcement. \"The most common reaction is, 'So what? What does a search really mean?' Our new study shows not only did Sheen's disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention, it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales,\" Ayers said.

When celebrities open up about their health \"The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV,\" said Steven Hoffman, scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. In 1991, when most people didn't have much information about the virus and the Internet was not commonly used, the American basketball star announced that he had tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA. \"Here was a very prominent athlete who is publicly disclosing being HIV-positive and opening up conversation around it for people,\" said Hoffman, who was not involved in the latest study. \"I think that's an example highlighting the positive role that celebrity can play in informing health decisions.\" Yet while Johnson's HIV disclosure spurred questions and conversations, since the virus was still unfamiliar, Sheen's disclosure was linked to action, Ayers said. After Sheen's announcement, about 1.25 million people in the United States searched online for topics directly related to condoms, HIV symptoms or HIV testing, according to Ayers' previous study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine last year. That study involved analyzing Google Trends and search term data from 2004 through November 2015, which included when Sheen disclosed his HIV status on November 17, 2015. The researchers found that Sheen's announcement corresponded with the greatest number of HIV-related Google searchers ever recorded in the US. But Sheen didn't make an immediate call to action for the public to get tested or use condoms, and public health groups didn't use him as a face to raise HIV awareness.

There couldn't be, because people didn't know what to do,\" Ayers said. \"Remember, people (were) asking, 'Can he play basketball?' 'Can I shake his hand?' There wasn't this trove of information about HIV, HIV prevention and HIV testing. When Sheen disclosed, there was this trove of information,\" he said. \"We saw people seeking out information on the signs of HIV, HIV testing and how to prevent HIV by using condoms.

Kosenko led a study in which 229 women were surveyed immediately after Jolie's announcement to undergo a double mastectomy. Researchers looked at whether Jolie influenced the women's genetic testing intentions. JUST WATCHED Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion Replay More Videos ...

The others reported that they would not get tested. Kosenko said that separate studies demonstrated increased genetic testing requests and Internet searches related to BRCA1 after Jolie's announcement. \"We rely heavily on friends and family for health information, and we tend to see certain celebrities as friends. Unfortunately, we do not share the same resources as these famous 'friends,' which impacts our ability to follow celebrity health advice,\" she said. \"For example, at the time of Jolie's announcement, the genetic tests she underwent were prohibitively expensive for the average American.\" There are examples of celebrities having a potentially harmful influence on public health too, said Hoffman, director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. 'I do blame celebrities' \"The most prominent example of harm would be, in my mind, Jenny McCarthy,\" Hoffman said. The American actress has been a vocal autism activist, spreading concerns that autism might be associated with childhood vaccines. McCarthy was unavailable for comment, but her representative said she addressed her stance on vaccines in an op-ed published in the Chicago Sun-Times in 2014, headlined \"The gray area on vaccines.\" Her son, Evan, was diagnosed with autism . She believes that doctors should change some children's vaccine schedules, such as allowing for one shot per doctor's visit instead of multiple shots, she wrote in the op-ed. \"I am not 'anti-vaccine.' This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, 'pro-vaccine' and for years I have been wrongly branded as 'anti-vaccine,' \" McCarthy wrote. \"My beautiful son, Evan, inspired this mother to question the 'one size fits all' philosophy of the recommended vaccine schedule,\" she wrote. \"I embarked on this quest not only for myself and my family, but for countless parents who shared my desire for knowledge that could lead to options and alternate schedules, but never to eliminate the vaccines.\" \"She is actually recommending practices that are unhealthful and potentially dangerous,\" Hoffman said about McCarthy's stance on changing vaccine schedules. \"Recommending to people not to vaccinate their children means not only are the children being subjected to unnecessary harm, but many others around those children who might not be able to get vaccinated for legitimate reasons are put at an additional risk ask well,\" he said. \"It's not only unfair to the children who aren't being vaccinated, but also to the many people who can't be vaccinated, who interact with those children.\" Even though they are vulnerable to illness, some people may not be able to get certain vaccines based on age, an allergy or pre-existing health condition, or other factors, according to the CDC Public health experts also have accused actress Gwyneth Paltrow of spreading some questionable health tips through her lifestyle blog, goop. In a written statement, goop spokeswoman Noora Raj Brown described the website as pushing \"new ideas into the conversation\" in health and wellness. \"We have a disclaimer on the bottom of every article that states the purpose is to highlight alternative studies and induce conversation. It's not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The views of the experts profiled don't necessarily represent the views of goop,\" the statement said. One blog post on goop recommended inserting a rock, called a jade egg, into your vagina to improve your sex life and orgasms, among other benefits. Some experts have said that not thoroughly cleaning or sterilizing the jade egg could lead to infection , or that it could get stuck. \"In many cases, there are opposing opinions on issues -- like the jade eggs for example -- and our role is to service the conversation,\" Brown said. \"Gwyneth Paltrow's messages, it's mostly that she's recommending practices that don't work,\" Hoffman said. \"The biggest harm is the loss or waste of money and the misplaced attention away from practices that actually work.\" jade egg on goop costs about $66. Hoffman said that the money could be better spent on buying nutritious foods or a gym membership. \"Do celebrities have an impact on health outcomes? We know they do. ... There's so many studies out there that have demonstrated that when celebrities either give helpful or harmful advice to people, it's routinely followed,\" Hoffman said. \"I do blame celebrities, because they need to recognize the impact they can have and the potential harm that can result from it,\" he said. \"I definitely blame those who are spreading misinformation.\" How celebrities have hacked public health talks Hoffman and his colleagues published a review paper in the British Medical Journal to analyze the influence celebrities have on people's health decisions through the factors of economics, marketing, psychology and sociology. \"In marketing literature, they talk about a halo effect around celebrities, whereby people have a very positive view of celebrities, and when celebrities endorse a product or recommend a particular health practice, it transfers their golden glow from the celebrity to the products or practice,\" Hoffman said. \"In economics literature, there's recognition of something called signaling, which is whereby in a marketplace filled with competing ideas, people are constantly looking for a shortcut in order to identify which products or practices they should be following, and so a celebrity endorsing a product provides a cognitive shortcut to an otherwise very complicated decision,\" he said. \"There is increasing recognition of the role of social networks, and there's few people who have bigger social networks than celebrities. Just think of the number of Twitter followers some celebrities have cultivated.\" However, Ayers, author of the latest study, said it might not be that complicated. \"It's not so much about a celebrity effect,\" he said, adding that when celebrities speak out about health-related issues, it may resonate because they are speaking as humans with just as much vulnerability to health impacts as anyone else. \"Typically, public health uses top-down strategies. The most effective messages are believed to come from the experts, 'from the top.' The people who know the most about the subject, the people who are paid to sit around and think about the subject,\" Ayers said. \"It turns out, though, that if you look at the Sheen effect and if you look at these other examples of organic media events ... that's not the case. These messages, they come from the bottom; they come from ordinary people. People who aren't health experts. Sheen might be a celebrity, but he's not a health expert. Angelina Jolie is not a health expert,\" he said. All in all, Hoffman said, public health officials could work with celebrities to harness their fame to spread evidence-based health information and mitigate the spread of misinformation. He cited supermodel Christy Turlington Burns as a positive example of a celebrity working with public health authorities to promote positive health practices. She served as a spokeswoman in CDC promotional ads raising awareness about smoking cessation and the health risks of smoking.

Ayers said he saw public health officials utilize the power of Sheen's celebrity in real time, not during but after his HIV announcement. \"It turns out that actually because of our study, we got to see those things happen. When we published our study, a few weeks later, Charlie Sheen began speaking out about HIV prevention, particularly condoms, and he cited our study as one of the reasons for doing that,\" Ayers said of the study on Google searches. \"We also saw several leading organizations in HIV prevention begin to use Charlie Sheen's disclosure as a way to promote HIV prevention.\" Hoffman said it would be beneficial to see more examples of celebrities and public health leaders working together in the future. \"I think there probably are a lot of celebrities who want to do good and would be open to the idea of working with public health officials to do good,\" he said. \"We just need to still figure out the best way of doing that, in terms of what would be most effective.\" For now, to make informed health decisions, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, offered some guidance in an email. \"Get a second opinion,\" he wrote. \"Trust but verify celebrity statements from trusted health sources like the American Cancer Society, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, APHA, American Academy of Pediatrics\" and others.", "summary_dict": {"headline": "Celebrities' hidden role in public health", "author": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "date_publish": "2017-05-18 15:00:44", "date_modify": "None", "date_download": "2021-06-16 15:11:52", "language": "en", "image_url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151116183619-16-charlie-sheen-through-the-years-super-tease.jpg", "filename": "https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/18/health/celebrity-health-charlie-sheen-study/.json", "description": "When celebrities speak, it seems like the world listens.

Just look at what happened after Charlie Sheen's HIV disclosure two years ago, said John Ayers , a research professor at San Diego State University. Sales of in-home HIV testing kits reached record highs around the same time the actor announced that he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2015, according to a study published in the journal Prevention Science on Thursday. Ayers was a co-author of the study. About the same time, \"in record numbers, people were going online, seeking out information on what the signs of HIV are, on how to find and appropriately prevent HIV with devices such as condoms and also how to get tested,'\" Ayers said. \"We've seen this ... many times over.\" For the new study, Ayers and his co-authors monitored weekly sales of OraQuick, the only FDA-approved at-home oral HIV testing kit available in the United States, from 2014 to 2016. The researchers found that there were 8,225 more sales than they expected the week of Sheen's HIV status announcement. Elevated sales continued for four weeks after Sheen's disclosure. The findings show a correlation, not a direct causation. Yet in a previous study, Ayers and his colleagues also found that Google searches for HIV testing and related topics also spiked after Sheen's announcement. \"The most common reaction is, 'So what? What does a search really mean?' Our new study shows not only did Sheen's disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention, it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales,\" Ayers said. Though they are not doctors, many celebrities have had both positive and negative ties to public health in recent years. When celebrities open up about their health \"The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV,\" said Steven Hoffman, scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab.

Powerful men including CEOS, political candidates and public figures were expelled from their positions because of growing numbers of allegations. In 2017, TIME magazine named the \"silence breakers\" of the movement as the coveted Person of the Year. As the movement continues to shape power dynamics and address once-normalized mistreatment of women (and men), EBONY.com looks back on powerful moments #MeToo had during the past 12 months. Times Up After a slew of sexual misconduct scandals in 2017, some women in Hollywood took action. On Jan. 1, 2018, 300 prominent women in the film, theater and TV industry signed a full-page letter in The New York Times and the Spanish language newspaper La Opinion to exhibit solidarity for working-class women who experienced sexual assault. According to the initiatives website, the Times Up movement is a \"unified call for change from women in entertainment for women everywhere. From movie sets to farm fields to boardrooms alike, we envision nationwide leadership that reflects the world in which we live.\" Through the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, money is raised to help support less-privileged victims of sexual assault and harassment cases with their legal fees #MuteRKelly Despite more than 20 years of sex assault allegations against R. Kelly, his career had remained mostly unaffected until this year. The singer had tour dates in Chicago and New York City canceled as a result of a July 2017 article that accused Kelly of running a \"sex cult.\" On April 30, the Women of Color committee of the Times Up organization announced that it would be joining the #MuteRKelly campaign, which was created by Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye last year in response to the continued sexual assault allegations against the singer. These accusations seem have had little to no effect on R. Kellys career. As with the current onslaught of sexual misconduct allegations against prominent men in the entertainment industry, the campaign calls for RCA Records and other companies to stop working with the 51-year-old artist. \"Today we join an existing online campaign called #MuteRKelly,\" states the letter from the committee posted exclusively on The Root. \"Over the past 25 years, the man known publicly as R. Kelly has sold 60 million albums, toured the globe repeatedly and accumulated hundreds of millions of plays on radio and streaming services.\" The campaign would like to see Apple Music, Spotify and Ticketmaster stop promoting Kellys music and concerts. The campaign also called for an investigation of Kelly. Spotify removed the singers music from its promoted playlists in May, but it was ultimately returned after backlash about censorship. Surviving R. Kelly, a six-hour docuseries exploring the abuse claims made against the R&B singer, will air on Lifetime in three parts on Jan. 3-5 at 9 p.m. ET. Terry Crews Testifies Survivors Bill of Rights https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hldAnf6EEeA Terry Crews delivered a powerful testimony on June 26 at Capitol Hill condemning \"toxic masculinity\" and its effects on sexual assault. The actor explained the \"critical\" need for the proposed Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights, which was drafted by sexual assault survivor Amanda Nguyen, and establishes consistent rules and procedures for prosecuting sexual assault crimes. \"I am an actor, author, former athlete, advocate and a survivor of a sexual assault,\" Crews said in his opening statement. He talked about his accusing Adam Venit, a talent agent with William Morris Endeavor (WME), of groping him at a party in 2016. Crews testimony and continued work on being a voice has helped other men get over the stigma that only weak or gay men can be victims of sexual assault. 141 Sexual Abuse Survivors Accept Courage Award at ESPYS Six-time Olympic winning gymnast Aly Raisman and dozens of other survivors of disgraced USA Gymnastics and Michigan State team doctor Larry Nassar accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award on July 18 at the 2018 ESPYS. In a powerful display of solidarity, the women who call themselves \"sister survivors\" presented the message, \"We may suffer alone, but we survive together.\" The award is given annually to athletes who embody the spirit and tenacity of late tennis legend and human rights activist Arthur Ashe. Nassar is serving 40 to 175 years in prison for sexually abusing more than 150 women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment over the past 20 years. Bill Cosby Sentencing In September, Bill Cosby, 81, was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004 at his Pennsylvania home. His is the first celebrity conviction of the #MeToo movement. Like with many other celebrities accused of sexual misconduct and assault, rumors and speculation about Cosbys behavior circulated for years. In 2014, comedian Hannibal Burress made a joke about the Ghost Dad stars alleged actions, which caused the public to reevaluate the fallen comics mistreatment of women.

Google searches for information about sexual harassment and assault -- as well as reporting or preventing such behavior -- spiked in the months after actress Alyssa Milano brought the #MeToo movement fresh attention in October 2017, a study published online Dec. 21 in JAMA Internal Medicine found. \"Our study reveals that even months after the beginning of #MeToo, millions more than otherwise expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online,\" said senior researcher John Ayers, an associate adjunct professor with the University of California, San Diego. \"Revealing this record-setting and sustained engagement is a call to action for the nation.\" Searches related to sexual harassment and assault were 51 percent higher than expected between Oct. 15, 2017 and June 15, 2018, Ayers and his colleagues found. On the afternoon of Oct. 15, 2017, Milano responded to public accusations of sexual harassment and assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein with a tweet sent to her followers: \"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet.\" Searches related to reporting sexual assault and preventive training on sexual harassment were 30 percent higher during that same period, researchers found. \"#MeToo is not the first movement to empower victims of sexual violence, but what is unique compared to past movements is #MeToo's staying power,\" Ayers said. \"Eight months since the initiation of #MeToo, millions more than expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. #MeToo's sustainability, and our study alerting leaders to this, could yield major wins for the nation's public health.\" These findings verify that #MeToo made a real difference in terms of raising awareness and prompting action, said Karestan Koenen, a professor of psychiatric epidemiology with the Harvard T.H.

However, a team of California researchers says these virtual assistants have the the potential to help individuals fight addiction -- but they're not there yet. Investigators examined some of today's most popular intelligent virtual assistants and overwhelmingly found the devices failed to provide useful information in response to queries for addiction help. In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful. \"Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,\" study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego in La Jolla. \"Nevertheless, I don't want to look at these results and say this is a tragedy,\" Ayers told Medscape Medical News. \"What we're trying to do is shine the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants. So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?\" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said. This study was supported by the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program. Ayers and Bickmore have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. npj Digital Medicine.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added.

That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus.

The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for HIV is \"a good thing, regardless of who he is.\" Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this article. She is an anesthesiology resident at Massachusetts General Hospital and part of the ABC News medical unit.", "summary": "According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement.

However, a team of California researchers says these virtual assistants have the the potential to help individuals fight addiction -- but they're not there yet. Investigators examined some of today's most popular intelligent virtual assistants and overwhelmingly found the devices failed to provide useful information in response to queries for addiction help. In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful. \"Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,\" study investigator John W.

So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?\" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement. Still, in the wake of the nation's recent spate of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping, a similarly unregulated product, Ayers thinks CBD's online popularity should serve as a call to action for regulators. \"We already saw what can happen with vaping,\" he said. \"Imagine with the demand for CBD, if we have a tainted product out there.\"", "date": "2019-10-23T00:00:00Z", "image": {"focal_point": "Smart"}, "original_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514", "summary": "Searches for CBD spiked this year as awareness of the product grew.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use.

Nearly 39 percent of bisexual boys had considered suicide. \"There have been some indications that LGBQ youth face increased suicide risks, yet many believed the jury was still out,\" coauthor John Ayers said in a statement. \"Our study yields a clear verdict: LGBQ youth face staggeringly high suicide risks.\" Researchers now hope their findings help bring about change. They are encouraging health, political and social leaders to create strategies to help combat the issue. \"Our work has identified a serious problem, but fortunately decades of science and experience can be leveraged to address LGBQ youth's suicide risk,\" Ayers said. \"Now is the time to act.\" >>RELATED: Gay teen's organ donation denied", "summary": "After analyzing the results, they found that lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning teens were more than four times as likely to attempt suicide.

Worldwide, there were 36.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS in 2015--the year Sheen made his announcement.

Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at San Diego State University, was studying Google searches and news articles during the period around Sheen's announcement. His study, which appeared in JAMA Internal Medicine noted, unsurprisingly, that the number of searches and news stories involving the terms\"HIV\" showed a dramatic uptick in the days following Sheen's announcement. That's hardly a shock. Sheen's admission that he was HIV-positive was covered extensively. But there was another interesting uptick in the HIV-related search terms. Not only did people search more for \"HIV,\" people also searched more for \"HIV\" and \"symptoms,\" \"signs of,\" and \"testing.\" Ayers hypothesized that Sheen's disclosure might actually have had a positive effect on HIV awareness, encouraging people to get tested themselves.

Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in Prevention Science. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says \"OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheens disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... \" Just look at the jump in sales.

{"archived_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616190558/https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/", "article": "Miami and Baltimore- Urban Health Media Project reporter Vanessa Falcon, a high school student in Miami, interviewed Arin Jayes, 30, of Baltimore, about his gender identity journey and experience transitioning to a non-binary trans man. Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist. Q: How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long did it last? A: As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals develop their gender identity. Its something that may evolve throughout a persons lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation and class. For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the \"pronoun check\" posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take. My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used \"they/them\" pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using \"he\" pronouns and physically transitioning. I made this decision with the understanding that I wasnt transitioning because I identified as a \"man\" per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, Ive passed as male about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!) When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say \"non-binary,\" and that my pronouns are \"he or they -- either as fine.\" I am leaning into presenting as femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine, because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important. Q: Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why? A: Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didnt initially know what being transgender meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget. Luckily, there is a lot of information and help available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities. For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help people navigate the name and gender marker change process. One side effect that I didnt entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, \"Will people here be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?\" As a white and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership -- and that of their successors in our movements -- must be recognized. Q: Did you have, or do you currently have, any regrets about transitioning? A: What I think this question is getting at is, \"How do you know youre sure?\" This was a question that I asked myself many times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes to my body. My answer to that is: I didnt truly know it was right until after I did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, \"Why on earth would you do something so permanent if you werent sure?\" But It took a leap of faith. And, as someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesnt feel right, you know. It is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to stop your physical transition, you dont need to think of it as \"de-transitioning.\" The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots. Q: How has transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem and mental health? A: Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient. Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power of our community. Q: What advice would you give to other people who want to follow the path you did?

Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist. Q: How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long did it last? A: As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals develop their gender identity. Its something that may evolve throughout a persons lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation and class. For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the \"pronoun check\" posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take. My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used \"they/them\" pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using \"he\" pronouns and physically transitioning. I made this decision with the understanding that I wasnt transitioning because I identified as a \"man\" per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, Ive passed as male about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!) When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say \"non-binary,\" and that my pronouns are \"he or they -- either as fine.\" I am leaning into presenting as femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine, because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important. Q: Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why? A: Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didnt initially know what being transgender meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget. Luckily, there is a lot of information and help available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities. For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help people navigate the name and gender marker change process. One side effect that I didnt entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, \"Will people here be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?\" As a white and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership -- and that of their successors in our movements -- must be recognized. Q: Did you have, or do you currently have, any regrets about transitioning? A: What I think this question is getting at is, \"How do you know youre sure?\" This was a question that I asked myself many times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes to my body. My answer to that is: I didnt truly know it was right until after I did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, \"Why on earth would you do something so permanent if you werent sure?\" But It took a leap of faith. And, as someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesnt feel right, you know. It is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to stop your physical transition, you dont need to think of it as \"de-transitioning.\" The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots. Q: How has transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem and mental health? A: Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient. Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power of our community. Q: What advice would you give to other people who want to follow the path you did? A: Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there are no rules! You dont have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition. Youre in the drivers seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms you will occupy it.

Nar de celebre Hollywod-personager fortaeller om deres personlige ve og vel, kan det males, at det vaekker gehor i befolkningen. Det beretter det amerikanske medie, CNN. Et nyt studie fra Universitetet i San Diego har undersogt sammenhaengen mellem, hvad kendte amerikanere fejler, og hvilke skavanker befolkningen gar til laege med. Da den amerikanske skuespiller og notorisk badboy, Charlie Sheen, i 2015 afslorede, at han var testet HIV-positiv, naede salget af HIV-test rekordhojder umiddelbart efter. Og kausaliteten er John Ayers, forskningsprofessor ved Universitetet i San Diego, ikke i tvivl om. >>I rekordnumre gik folk online og sogte oplysninger om, hvad tegn pa HIV er, hvordan man opdager det og pa passende vis kan beskytte sig mod HIV, og ogsa hvordan man bliver testet,<< siger fortaeller John Ayers til CNN. >>Det er noget, vi har set igen og igen.<< John Ayers har sammen med et storre forskningshold netop offentliggjort en undersogelse i tidsskriftet Prevention Science, hvor de mener at kunne bevise en kausal sammenhaeng mellem kendissers sygdomme og skavanker og befolkningens ditto. I deres seneste studie overvagede John Ayers og hans medforfattere ugentligt salget af OraQuick, det eneste godkendte hjemme HIV-test kit, der er tilgaengeligt i USA fra 2014 til 2016. Forskerne opdagede, at der var 8.225 flere salg af praeparatet i forbindelse med Charlie Sheen udmeddelelse. Det er det hojeste niveau historisk set. Det forhojede salg salg fortsatte i fire uger efter Sheens afsloring. Resultaterne viser en sammenhaeng, ikke en direkte arsagssammenhaeng. Men i en tidligere undersogelse fandt John Ayers og hans kolleger ogsa, at Google-sogninger efter HIV-testning og relaterede emner ogsa var pa historisk hojt niveau efter Charlie Sheens udmelding. >>Vores nye undersogelse viser ikke kun, at (Charlie, red.) Sheens afsloring fik folk til at soge information om HIV-forebyggelse, men afsloringen forte ogsa til rekordniveauet for HIV-testsalg pa hjemmemarkedet,<< siger Ayers. >>Selvom de ikke er laeger, har mange beromtheder haft positive og negative tilknytninger til folkesundheden de seneste ar,<< uddyber han. Den sammen tendens sas da basketball-spilleren Earwin >>Magic<< Johnson tilbage i slutfirserne ogsa offentligt kom ud og fortalte, at han var blevet testet positiv for HIV. Fortaeller John Ayers. Kami Kosenko, der er professor i sundhedskommunikation ved North Carolina State University fortaeller til CNN om tilsvarende reaktioner, da skuespillerinden Angelina Jolie i 2013 meddelte, at hun havde valgt at fa fjernet sine bryster. Da den skuespillerens laeger fortalte hende, at risikoen for hun udviklede brystkraeft var pa 87 procent, fordi hun er baerer af genet BRCA1, besluttede Angelina Jolie fa bortopereret begge sine bryster, ligesom hun ogsa senere besluttede at fa hendes aeggestokke og aeggeleder fjernet i 2015. Ifolge Kami Kosenkos undersogelser har Angelina Jolie beslutninger har positiv indflydelse pa folkesundheden, da mange kvinder som reaktion pa skuespillerindens udmeldinger valgte at blive testet for, om de havde BCRA1-genet.", "summary": "Sa bliver det ikke mere postfaktuelt: Folk tror ikke pa, hvad deres laeger fortaeller dem, men nar kendte fejler noget, lytter folk efter.

Moreover, after actress Alyssa Milano's #MeToo tweet went viral in October 2017, #MeToo has caused Google searches about sexual assault to shatter records and reach an all-time high. Last October, The New York Times broke the news that Weinstein had faced numerous sexual assault allegations over the years, and that he had paid off his accusers. Since then, numerous prominent figures -- from actors and comedians to lawmakers and scientists -- have been held accountable for sexual violence and abuse, and the #MeToo movement has sparked increased awareness about these issues. Following the Weinstein scandal, researchers from Harvard Medical School and UC San Diego took a look at Google search rates for sexual harassment and sexual assault before and after Milano's #MeToo tweet. To start, the researchers examined trends in these searches from Jan. 1, 2004 to Oct. 14, 2017 -- the day before Milano first tweeted about #MeToo. They then used this data to roughly estimate how many times Americans would search for these subjects following her tweet, and found that searches for sexual harassment and assault were 86 percent higher than expected from Oct. 15, 2017 to June 15, 2018. Researchers also discovered a 51 percent increase in searches about preventive training for sexual harassment and assault, and a 30 percent increase in searches about reporting cases of sexual violence. According to the Chicago Tribune, Burke first coined the phrase \"Me Too\" in 2006, in order to support women -- especially black women and women of color -- who had survived sexual violence. Burke has continuously worked to combat sexual violence, so when she saw the #MeToo hashtag go viral in 2017, she was concerned that its extreme publicity could harm survivors. She told The Guardian that she was worried that the people tweeting about #MeToo wouldn't go beyond the hashtag, to chart a substantial course of action. During a TED Talk last month, Burke reminded viewers that the #MeToo movement is meant to serve marginalized communities that are disproportionately impacted by sexual violence. However, she maintained that she still believes in the possibility of \"a world free of sexual violence\" -- and the Harvard and UCSD researchers' work illustrates that many other people may share her desire to go beyond the hashtag. \"The post-#MeToo period corresponded with the greatest number of sexual harassment and/or assault searches ever recorded in the United States,\" the researchers wrote in their report, which was published on Friday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Specifically, in the eight months after Milano's #MeToo tweet, researchers found that there had been 40 to 54 million Google searches about understanding, preventing, and reporting sexual harassment and assault. \"Our findings demonstrate the power of grass-roots movements to respond to large-scale public health crises,\" the researchers concluded. \"Public health leaders should respond by investing in enhanced prevention training and improving resources for survivors.\" The research team also urged people to get more involved in combating sexual violence, noting that online search activity is not necessarily an indicator of how engaged people actually are.", "date": "2018-12-21T00:00:00Z", "image": {"focal_point": "Smart"}, "original_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/google-searches-about-sexual-assault-harassment-broke-a-record-after-metoo-researchers-say-15561117", "summary": "Moreover, after actress Alyssa Milano's #MeToo tweet went viral in October 2017, #MeToo has caused Google searches about sexual assault to shatter records and reach an all-time high.

Heat-not-burn cigarettes are battery-powered devices that take tobacco to the brink of combustion by heating tobacco leaves to around 500 degrees and producing an inhalable aerosol, researcher Theodore L. Caputi and colleagues wrote in a recent PLOS One-published study. The smoking alternative has exploded in Japan, where average monthly searches for heat-not-burn tobacco products rose 1,426 percent between 2015 and 2016, but clinicians are largely unaware of its cardiovascular risks. \"We do not know the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco,\" Caputi said in an email. \"While they are likely to be marketed--formally or informally--as 'healthier than cigarettes, there is insufficient evidence to make that claim. In itself, insufficient evidence is dangerous--tobacco companies have proven they wont wait until all the facts are in before they begin making health claims, and public health researchers need to fill in knowledge gaps quickly so that consumers can make well-informed decisions.\" Because of the public health implications of tobacco use, Caputi said, including the fact that nearly half of all smokers are estimated to die from a smoking-related illness, \"this is not a decision that consumers should take lightly.\" In his study, Caputi and four colleagues used Google search query data to analyze the rising popularity of heat-not-burn products. Because traditional surveys about smoking dont ask about heat-not-burn tobacco, and since the product has little visibility in U.S. markets, the researchers focused on search engine analysis to evaluate the scale and growth potential of the new trend. In Japan, they found, there are now between 5.9 and 7.5 million estimated heat-not-burn-related Google searches per month, based on estimates from September. After initial heat-not-burn products hit the Japanese market in 2015, spurring a nearly 1,500 percent peak in Google searches on the topic, related searches grew by an additional 100 percent during the next year. Caputi and colleagues compared search queries for heat-not-burn products in Japan to Google searches for e-cigarettes in the U.S., since e-cigarettes arent legal in Japan. Heat-not-burn searches occurred more frequently in Japan than e-cigarette searches did in the U.S., the authors reported, with the first queries for heat-not-burn cigarettes eclipsing e-cigarettes in April 2016. The popularity of e-cigarettes in the U.S. is waning, Caputi said in a September 2016 article published in the medical journal Tobacco Control. Whereas growth of the e-cig industry was predicted to rise 126 percent in 2016, new Euromonitor International statistics estimate the reality to be closer to 51 percent. E-cigarette users are becoming displeased with the taste of the product, he said, citing Wells Fargo tobacco analyst Bonnie Herzog. While consumers arent necessarily concerned with the health risks of the product, they notice a lag in gratification from e-cigarettes that isnt true for traditional cigarettes, which deliver nicotine to the bloodstream much more quickly. E-cigarettes also lack a \"throat hit,\" Caputi wrote, which many conventional tobacco users enjoy. Heat-not-burn products offer those feelings that e-cigarettes lack. \"The pervasiveness of e-cigarettes and spreading discontentment with the lack of a throat-hit may open the floodgate for heat-not-burns success,\" he wrote. Heat-not-burn cigarettes have been gradually introduced to an international market in more than 20 nations, including the United Kingdom, Russia, Korea, Switzerland and Italy, but the focal test market is Japan, Caputi and colleagues wrote in the PLOS One study. Japan Tobacco introduced its local heat-not-burn device, called Ploom TECH, in March 2016, and Philip Morris Internationals \"IQOS\" (\"I Quit Ordinary Smoking\") and British American Tobaccos \"Glo\" followed soon after. Now, PMI has entered the FDA approval process to start marketing and sales in the U.S. According to the Tobacco Control article, a Wells Fargo analyst predicted heat-not-burn products could displace up to 30 percent of the countrys combustible cigarette industry by 2025. Caputi wrote recent research has suggested heat-not-burn products are less harmful than combustible cigarettes, but other studies have shown risks of smoking heat-not-burn tobacco include carbon monoxide and formaldehyde exposure, as well as the potential for side-stream emissions. Reto Auer, MD, MAS, and colleagues found that PMIs IQOS releases smoke containing elements from pyrolysis and thermogenic degradation that mirror the components of traditional cigarette smoke. \"PMI claims that IQOS releases no smoke because the tobacco does not combust and the tobacco leaves are only heated, not burned,\" Auer and co-authors wrote in a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. \"However, there can be smoke without fire.

Now, PMI has entered the FDA approval process to start marketing and sales in the U.S. According to the Tobacco Control article, a Wells Fargo analyst predicted heat-not-burn products could displace up to 30 percent of the countrys combustible cigarette industry by 2025. Caputi wrote recent research has suggested heat-not-burn products are less harmful than combustible cigarettes, but other studies have shown risks of smoking heat-not-burn tobacco include carbon monoxide and formaldehyde exposure, as well as the potential for side-stream emissions. Reto Auer, MD, MAS, and colleagues found that PMIs IQOS releases smoke containing elements from pyrolysis and thermogenic degradation that mirror the components of traditional cigarette smoke. \"PMI claims that IQOS releases no smoke because the tobacco does not combust and the tobacco leaves are only heated, not burned,\" Auer and co-authors wrote in a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. \"However, there can be smoke without fire. Dancing around the definition of smoke to avoid indoor smoking bans is unethical.\" Now, Caputi said, is the time to act. In his PLOS One paper, he and co-authors wrote their findings were a \"clarion call\" for public health practitioners, who should expand heat-not-burn product surveillance, preemptively study the smoking alternatives risks and benefits and adjust health messaging about tobacco products. He said that despite the presence of the product overseas, clinicians in the U.S. are largely unaware of the trend and its implications. \"Unfortunately, we have insufficient evidence to make claims regarding the long-term health effects of either e-cigarettes or heat-not-burn devices, and so making comparisons at this point is very difficult,\" Caputi told Cardiovascular Business. \"However, we know that e-cigarettes are perceived as less harmful than traditional cigarettes, and we imagine heat-not-burn products will be marketed to cultivate that same perception. While its too early to tell if heat-not-burn products will overtake e-cigarettes as the new method of smoking, the available evidence suggests heat-not-burn products are poised for explosive growth as they are introduced into new markets.\"", "summary": "The smoking alternative has exploded in Japan, where average monthly searches for heat-not-burn tobacco products rose 1,426 percent between 2015 and 2016, but clinicians are largely unaware of its cardiovascular risks. \"We do not know the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco,\" Caputi said in an email. Caputi and colleagues compared search queries for heat-not-burn products in Japan to Google searches for e-cigarettes in the U.S., since e-cigarettes arent legal in Japan. Heat-not-burn searches occurred more frequently in Japan than e-cigarette searches did in the U.S., the authors reported, with the first queries for heat-not-burn cigarettes eclipsing e-cigarettes in April 2016. While its too early to tell if heat-not-burn products will overtake e-cigarettes as the new method of smoking, the available evidence suggests heat-not-burn products are poised for explosive growth as they are introduced into new markets.\"", "keyword": ["products", "cigarettes", "japan", "tobacco", "decreasing", "heatnotburn", "alternative", "smoking", "open", "floodgates", "ecigarettes", "caputi", "health", "searches", "popularity"], "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/vascular-endovascular/decreasing-popularity-e-cigarettes-could-open-floodgates-smoking"}}

{"archived_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616191106/https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/18/health/celebrity-health-charlie-sheen-study/", "article": "(CNN) When celebrities speak, it seems, the world listens -- even when it comes to personal and public health. Just look at what happened after Charlie Sheen's HIV disclosure two years ago, said John Ayers , a research professor at San Diego State University. Sales of in-home HIV testing kits reached record highs around the same time the actor announced that he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2015, according to a study published in the journal Prevention Science on Thursday. Ayers was a co-author of the study. About the same time, \"in record numbers, people were going online, seeking out information on what the signs of HIV are, on how to find and appropriately prevent HIV with devices such as condoms and also how to get tested,'\" Ayers said. \"We've seen this ... many times over.\" For the new study, Ayers and his co-authors monitored weekly sales of OraQuick, the only FDA-approved at-home oral HIV testing kit available in the United States, from 2014 to 2016. The researchers found that there were 8,225 more sales than they expected the week of Sheen's HIV status announcement. Elevated sales continued for four weeks after Sheen's disclosure. The findings show a correlation, not a direct causation. Yet in a previous study, Ayers and his colleagues also found that Google searches for HIV testing and related topics also spiked after Sheen's announcement. \"The most common reaction is, 'So what? What does a search really mean?' Our new study shows not only did Sheen's disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention, it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales,\" Ayers said. Though they are not doctors, many celebrities have had both positive and negative ties to public health in recent years. When celebrities open up about their health \"The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV,\" said Steven Hoffman, scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. In 1991, when most people didn't have much information about the virus and the Internet was not commonly used, the American basketball star announced that he had tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA. \"Here was a very prominent athlete who is publicly disclosing being HIV-positive and opening up conversation around it for people,\" said Hoffman, who was not involved in the latest study. \"I think that's an example highlighting the positive role that celebrity can play in informing health decisions.\" Yet while Johnson's HIV disclosure spurred questions and conversations, since the virus was still unfamiliar, Sheen's disclosure was linked to action, Ayers said. After Sheen's announcement, about 1.25 million people in the United States searched online for topics directly related to condoms, HIV symptoms or HIV testing, according to Ayers' previous study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine last year. That study involved analyzing Google Trends and search term data from 2004 through November 2015, which included when Sheen disclosed his HIV status on November 17, 2015. The researchers found that Sheen's announcement corresponded with the greatest number of HIV-related Google searchers ever recorded in the US. But Sheen didn't make an immediate call to action for the public to get tested or use condoms, and public health groups didn't use him as a face to raise HIV awareness.

MUST WATCH Celebrities who changed the face of HIV 01:08 Therefore, Sheen's disclosure was an example of how -- without the celebrity or public health leaders calling for action -- the public appeared to still respond based on health information that was widely known, Ayers said. \"When Magic Johnson made his disclosure, there wasn't a similar reaction. There couldn't be, because people didn't know what to do,\" Ayers said. \"Remember, people (were) asking, 'Can he play basketball?' 'Can I shake his hand?' There wasn't this trove of information about HIV, HIV prevention and HIV testing. When Sheen disclosed, there was this trove of information,\" he said. \"We saw people seeking out information on the signs of HIV, HIV testing and how to prevent HIV by using condoms. We saw this trilogy of reaction that is fairly consistent with what public health has been promoting for 20-plus years.\" JUST WATCHED The 'Angelina effect' on cancer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The 'Angelina effect' on cancer 02:22 Kami Kosenko, an associate professor of health communication at North Carolina State University, said that she believes actress Angelina Jolie's 2013 announcement of a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer also had a positive influence on public health, despite possibly influencing an uptick in unnecessary genetic testing. Kosenko led a study in which 229 women were surveyed immediately after Jolie's announcement to undergo a double mastectomy. Researchers looked at whether Jolie influenced the women's genetic testing intentions. JUST WATCHED Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion 06:07 The study, published in the Journal of Health Communication last year, showed that 30% of the women intended to get tested to see whether they carried the BRCA1 gene, 23% said they would probably get tested, and 7% said they would definitely get tested. The others reported that they would not get tested. Kosenko said that separate studies demonstrated increased genetic testing requests and Internet searches related to BRCA1 after Jolie's announcement. \"We rely heavily on friends and family for health information, and we tend to see certain celebrities as friends. Unfortunately, we do not share the same resources as these famous 'friends,' which impacts our ability to follow celebrity health advice,\" she said. \"For example, at the time of Jolie's announcement, the genetic tests she underwent were prohibitively expensive for the average American.\" There are examples of celebrities having a potentially harmful influence on public health too, said Hoffman, director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. 'I do blame celebrities' \"The most prominent example of harm would be, in my mind, Jenny McCarthy,\" Hoffman said. The American actress has been a vocal autism activist, spreading concerns that autism might be associated with childhood vaccines. McCarthy was unavailable for comment, but her representative said she addressed her stance on vaccines in an op-ed published in the Chicago Sun-Times in 2014, headlined \"The gray area on vaccines.\" Her son, Evan, was diagnosed with autism . She believes that doctors should change some children's vaccine schedules, such as allowing for one shot per doctor's visit instead of multiple shots, she wrote in the op-ed. \"I am not 'anti-vaccine.' This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, 'pro-vaccine' and for years I have been wrongly branded as 'anti-vaccine,' \" McCarthy wrote. \"My beautiful son, Evan, inspired this mother to question the 'one size fits all' philosophy of the recommended vaccine schedule,\" she wrote. \"I embarked on this quest not only for myself and my family, but for countless parents who shared my desire for knowledge that could lead to options and alternate schedules, but never to eliminate the vaccines.\" \"She is actually recommending practices that are unhealthful and potentially dangerous,\" Hoffman said about McCarthy's stance on changing vaccine schedules. \"Recommending to people not to vaccinate their children means not only are the children being subjected to unnecessary harm, but many others around those children who might not be able to get vaccinated for legitimate reasons are put at an additional risk ask well,\" he said. \"It's not only unfair to the children who aren't being vaccinated, but also to the many people who can't be vaccinated, who interact with those children.\" Even though they are vulnerable to illness, some people may not be able to get certain vaccines based on age, an allergy or pre-existing health condition, or other factors, according to the CDC Public health experts also have accused actress Gwyneth Paltrow of spreading some questionable health tips through her lifestyle blog, goop. In a written statement, goop spokeswoman Noora Raj Brown described the website as pushing \"new ideas into the conversation\" in health and wellness. \"We have a disclaimer on the bottom of every article that states the purpose is to highlight alternative studies and induce conversation. It's not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The views of the experts profiled don't necessarily represent the views of goop,\" the statement said. One blog post on goop recommended inserting a rock, called a jade egg, into your vagina to improve your sex life and orgasms, among other benefits. Some experts have said that not thoroughly cleaning or sterilizing the jade egg could lead to infection , or that it could get stuck. \"In many cases, there are opposing opinions on issues -- like the jade eggs for example -- and our role is to service the conversation,\" Brown said. \"Gwyneth Paltrow's messages, it's mostly that she's recommending practices that don't work,\" Hoffman said. \"The biggest harm is the loss or waste of money and the misplaced attention away from practices that actually work.\" jade egg on goop costs about $66. Hoffman said that the money could be better spent on buying nutritious foods or a gym membership. \"Do celebrities have an impact on health outcomes? We know they do. ... There's so many studies out there that have demonstrated that when celebrities either give helpful or harmful advice to people, it's routinely followed,\" Hoffman said. \"I do blame celebrities, because they need to recognize the impact they can have and the potential harm that can result from it,\" he said. \"I definitely blame those who are spreading misinformation.\" How celebrities have hacked public health talks Hoffman and his colleagues published a review paper in the British Medical Journal to analyze the influence celebrities have on people's health decisions through the factors of economics, marketing, psychology and sociology. \"In marketing literature, they talk about a halo effect around celebrities, whereby people have a very positive view of celebrities, and when celebrities endorse a product or recommend a particular health practice, it transfers their golden glow from the celebrity to the products or practice,\" Hoffman said. \"In economics literature, there's recognition of something called signaling, which is whereby in a marketplace filled with competing ideas, people are constantly looking for a shortcut in order to identify which products or practices they should be following, and so a celebrity endorsing a product provides a cognitive shortcut to an otherwise very complicated decision,\" he said. \"There is increasing recognition of the role of social networks, and there's few people who have bigger social networks than celebrities. Just think of the number of Twitter followers some celebrities have cultivated.\" However, Ayers, author of the latest study, said it might not be that complicated. \"It's not so much about a celebrity effect,\" he said, adding that when celebrities speak out about health-related issues, it may resonate because they are speaking as humans with just as much vulnerability to health impacts as anyone else. \"Typically, public health uses top-down strategies. The most effective messages are believed to come from the experts, 'from the top.' The people who know the most about the subject, the people who are paid to sit around and think about the subject,\" Ayers said. \"It turns out, though, that if you look at the Sheen effect and if you look at these other examples of organic media events ... that's not the case. These messages, they come from the bottom; they come from ordinary people. People who aren't health experts. Sheen might be a celebrity, but he's not a health expert. Angelina Jolie is not a health expert,\" he said. All in all, Hoffman said, public health officials could work with celebrities to harness their fame to spread evidence-based health information and mitigate the spread of misinformation. He cited supermodel Christy Turlington Burns as a positive example of a celebrity working with public health authorities to promote positive health practices. She served as a spokeswoman in CDC promotional ads raising awareness about smoking cessation and the health risks of smoking.

Ayers said he saw public health officials utilize the power of Sheen's celebrity in real time, not during but after his HIV announcement. \"It turns out that actually because of our study, we got to see those things happen. When we published our study, a few weeks later, Charlie Sheen began speaking out about HIV prevention, particularly condoms, and he cited our study as one of the reasons for doing that,\" Ayers said of the study on Google searches. \"We also saw several leading organizations in HIV prevention begin to use Charlie Sheen's disclosure as a way to promote HIV prevention.\" Hoffman said it would be beneficial to see more examples of celebrities and public health leaders working together in the future. \"I think there probably are a lot of celebrities who want to do good and would be open to the idea of working with public health officials to do good,\" he said. \"We just need to still figure out the best way of doing that, in terms of what would be most effective.\" For now, to make informed health decisions, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, offered some guidance in an email. \"Get a second opinion,\" he wrote. \"Trust but verify celebrity statements from trusted health sources like the American Cancer Society, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, APHA, American Academy of Pediatrics\" and others.", "date": "2017-05-18T00:00:00Z", "image": {"focal_point": "Smart"}, "original_link": "https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/18/health/celebrity-health-charlie-sheen-study/", "summary": "(CNN) When celebrities speak, it seems, the world listens -- even when it comes to personal and public health.

Just look at what happened after Charlie Sheen's HIV disclosure two years ago, said John Ayers , a research professor at San Diego State University. Sales of in-home HIV testing kits reached record highs around the same time the actor announced that he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2015, according to a study published in the journal Prevention Science on Thursday. Ayers was a co-author of the study. About the same time, \"in record numbers, people were going online, seeking out information on what the signs of HIV are, on how to find and appropriately prevent HIV with devices such as condoms and also how to get tested,'\" Ayers said. \"We've seen this ... many times over.\" For the new study, Ayers and his co-authors monitored weekly sales of OraQuick, the only FDA-approved at-home oral HIV testing kit available in the United States, from 2014 to 2016. The researchers found that there were 8,225 more sales than they expected the week of Sheen's HIV status announcement. Elevated sales continued for four weeks after Sheen's disclosure. The findings show a correlation, not a direct causation. Yet in a previous study, Ayers and his colleagues also found that Google searches for HIV testing and related topics also spiked after Sheen's announcement. \"The most common reaction is, 'So what? What does a search really mean?' Our new study shows not only did Sheen's disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention, it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales,\" Ayers said. Though they are not doctors, many celebrities have had both positive and negative ties to public health in recent years. When celebrities open up about their health \"The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV,\" said Steven Hoffman, scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. In 1991, when most people didn't have much information about the virus and the Internet was not commonly used, the American basketball star announced that he had tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA. \"Here was a very prominent athlete who is publicly disclosing being HIV-positive and opening up conversation around it for people,\" said Hoffman, who was not involved in the latest study. \"I think that's an example highlighting the positive role that celebrity can play in informing health decisions.\" Yet while Johnson's HIV disclosure spurred questions and conversations, since the virus was still unfamiliar, Sheen's disclosure was linked to action, Ayers said. After Sheen's announcement, about 1.25 million people in the United States searched online for topics directly related to condoms, HIV symptoms or HIV testing, according to Ayers' previous study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine last year. That study involved analyzing Google Trends and search term data from 2004 through November 2015, which included when Sheen disclosed his HIV status on November 17, 2015. The researchers found that Sheen's announcement corresponded with the greatest number of HIV-related Google searchers ever recorded in the US. But Sheen didn't make an immediate call to action for the public to get tested or use condoms, and public health groups didn't use him as a face to raise HIV awareness.

MUST WATCH Celebrities who changed the face of HIV 01:08 Therefore, Sheen's disclosure was an example of how -- without the celebrity or public health leaders calling for action -- the public appeared to still respond based on health information that was widely known, Ayers said. \"When Magic Johnson made his disclosure, there wasn't a similar reaction. There couldn't be, because people didn't know what to do,\" Ayers said. \"Remember, people (were) asking, 'Can he play basketball?' 'Can I shake his hand?' There wasn't this trove of information about HIV, HIV prevention and HIV testing. When Sheen disclosed, there was this trove of information,\" he said. \"We saw people seeking out information on the signs of HIV, HIV testing and how to prevent HIV by using condoms.

Kosenko led a study in which 229 women were surveyed immediately after Jolie's announcement to undergo a double mastectomy. Researchers looked at whether Jolie influenced the women's genetic testing intentions. JUST WATCHED Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion 06:07 The study, published in the Journal of Health Communication last year, showed that 30% of the women intended to get tested to see whether they carried the BRCA1 gene, 23% said they would probably get tested, and 7% said they would definitely get tested. The others reported that they would not get tested. Kosenko said that separate studies demonstrated increased genetic testing requests and Internet searches related to BRCA1 after Jolie's announcement. \"We rely heavily on friends and family for health information, and we tend to see certain celebrities as friends. Unfortunately, we do not share the same resources as these famous 'friends,' which impacts our ability to follow celebrity health advice,\" she said. \"For example, at the time of Jolie's announcement, the genetic tests she underwent were prohibitively expensive for the average American.\" There are examples of celebrities having a potentially harmful influence on public health too, said Hoffman, director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. 'I do blame celebrities' \"The most prominent example of harm would be, in my mind, Jenny McCarthy,\" Hoffman said. The American actress has been a vocal autism activist, spreading concerns that autism might be associated with childhood vaccines. McCarthy was unavailable for comment, but her representative said she addressed her stance on vaccines in an op-ed published in the Chicago Sun-Times in 2014, headlined \"The gray area on vaccines.\" Her son, Evan, was diagnosed with autism . She believes that doctors should change some children's vaccine schedules, such as allowing for one shot per doctor's visit instead of multiple shots, she wrote in the op-ed. \"I am not 'anti-vaccine.' This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, 'pro-vaccine' and for years I have been wrongly branded as 'anti-vaccine,' \" McCarthy wrote. \"My beautiful son, Evan, inspired this mother to question the 'one size fits all' philosophy of the recommended vaccine schedule,\" she wrote. \"I embarked on this quest not only for myself and my family, but for countless parents who shared my desire for knowledge that could lead to options and alternate schedules, but never to eliminate the vaccines.\" \"She is actually recommending practices that are unhealthful and potentially dangerous,\" Hoffman said about McCarthy's stance on changing vaccine schedules. \"Recommending to people not to vaccinate their children means not only are the children being subjected to unnecessary harm, but many others around those children who might not be able to get vaccinated for legitimate reasons are put at an additional risk ask well,\" he said. \"It's not only unfair to the children who aren't being vaccinated, but also to the many people who can't be vaccinated, who interact with those children.\" Even though they are vulnerable to illness, some people may not be able to get certain vaccines based on age, an allergy or pre-existing health condition, or other factors, according to the CDC Public health experts also have accused actress Gwyneth Paltrow of spreading some questionable health tips through her lifestyle blog, goop. In a written statement, goop spokeswoman Noora Raj Brown described the website as pushing \"new ideas into the conversation\" in health and wellness. \"We have a disclaimer on the bottom of every article that states the purpose is to highlight alternative studies and induce conversation. It's not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The views of the experts profiled don't necessarily represent the views of goop,\" the statement said. One blog post on goop recommended inserting a rock, called a jade egg, into your vagina to improve your sex life and orgasms, among other benefits. Some experts have said that not thoroughly cleaning or sterilizing the jade egg could lead to infection , or that it could get stuck. \"In many cases, there are opposing opinions on issues -- like the jade eggs for example -- and our role is to service the conversation,\" Brown said. \"Gwyneth Paltrow's messages, it's mostly that she's recommending practices that don't work,\" Hoffman said. \"The biggest harm is the loss or waste of money and the misplaced attention away from practices that actually work.\" jade egg on goop costs about $66. Hoffman said that the money could be better spent on buying nutritious foods or a gym membership. \"Do celebrities have an impact on health outcomes? We know they do. ... There's so many studies out there that have demonstrated that when celebrities either give helpful or harmful advice to people, it's routinely followed,\" Hoffman said. \"I do blame celebrities, because they need to recognize the impact they can have and the potential harm that can result from it,\" he said. \"I definitely blame those who are spreading misinformation.\" How celebrities have hacked public health talks Hoffman and his colleagues published a review paper in the British Medical Journal to analyze the influence celebrities have on people's health decisions through the factors of economics, marketing, psychology and sociology. \"In marketing literature, they talk about a halo effect around celebrities, whereby people have a very positive view of celebrities, and when celebrities endorse a product or recommend a particular health practice, it transfers their golden glow from the celebrity to the products or practice,\" Hoffman said. \"In economics literature, there's recognition of something called signaling, which is whereby in a marketplace filled with competing ideas, people are constantly looking for a shortcut in order to identify which products or practices they should be following, and so a celebrity endorsing a product provides a cognitive shortcut to an otherwise very complicated decision,\" he said. \"There is increasing recognition of the role of social networks, and there's few people who have bigger social networks than celebrities. Just think of the number of Twitter followers some celebrities have cultivated.\" However, Ayers, author of the latest study, said it might not be that complicated. \"It's not so much about a celebrity effect,\" he said, adding that when celebrities speak out about health-related issues, it may resonate because they are speaking as humans with just as much vulnerability to health impacts as anyone else. \"Typically, public health uses top-down strategies. The most effective messages are believed to come from the experts, 'from the top.' The people who know the most about the subject, the people who are paid to sit around and think about the subject,\" Ayers said. \"It turns out, though, that if you look at the Sheen effect and if you look at these other examples of organic media events ... that's not the case. These messages, they come from the bottom; they come from ordinary people. People who aren't health experts. Sheen might be a celebrity, but he's not a health expert. Angelina Jolie is not a health expert,\" he said. All in all, Hoffman said, public health officials could work with celebrities to harness their fame to spread evidence-based health information and mitigate the spread of misinformation. He cited supermodel Christy Turlington Burns as a positive example of a celebrity working with public health authorities to promote positive health practices. She served as a spokeswoman in CDC promotional ads raising awareness about smoking cessation and the health risks of smoking.

Ayers said he saw public health officials utilize the power of Sheen's celebrity in real time, not during but after his HIV announcement. \"It turns out that actually because of our study, we got to see those things happen. When we published our study, a few weeks later, Charlie Sheen began speaking out about HIV prevention, particularly condoms, and he cited our study as one of the reasons for doing that,\" Ayers said of the study on Google searches. \"We also saw several leading organizations in HIV prevention begin to use Charlie Sheen's disclosure as a way to promote HIV prevention.\" Hoffman said it would be beneficial to see more examples of celebrities and public health leaders working together in the future. \"I think there probably are a lot of celebrities who want to do good and would be open to the idea of working with public health officials to do good,\" he said. \"We just need to still figure out the best way of doing that, in terms of what would be most effective.\" For now, to make informed health decisions, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, offered some guidance in an email. \"Get a second opinion,\" he wrote. \"Trust but verify celebrity statements from trusted health sources like the American Cancer Society, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, APHA, American Academy of Pediatrics\" and others.", "summary_dict": {"headline": "Celebrities' hidden role in public health", "author": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "date_publish": "2017-05-18 15:00:44", "date_modify": "None", "date_download": "2021-06-16 15:33:06", "language": "en", "image_url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151116183619-16-charlie-sheen-through-the-years-super-tease.jpg", "filename": "https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/18/health/celebrity-health-charlie-sheen-study/.json", "description": "When celebrities speak, it seems like the world listens.

In a more recent follow-up study, also by Prof Ayers, the team investigated whether internet search queries, which they based on Google Trends data on searches with \"test,\" \"tests,\" or \"testing\" and \"HIV,\" showed a link with an increase in HIV testing. The researchers collected data on sales of OraQuick, the only rapid at-home HIV test kit available in the United States, and found that in the same week Sheen made his TV appearance, sales in OraQuick nearly doubled, reaching an all-time high.

The study that attracted their ire last year, from Swiss researchers, showed higher levels of most dangerous chemicals than the company reported in its own work, though.

It's already popular in Japan, and tobacco companies are seeking to gain approval for their products here in the U.S. It's Toasted Philip Morris, which produces the Marlboro brand, has seen sales of its IQOS device in Japan far outpace its production capabilities in the past few years. The pen-sized device uses a small heating blade to warm a plug of tobacco to a over 600 degrees Fahrenheit, not hot enough to ignite it, but sufficient to produce a nicotine-laced vapor which the user can inhale. The product is a healthier alternative to their cigarettes, the company claims. A new study from public health researcher John Ayers in the journal PLOS ONE suggests that the market for heat-not-burn tobacco products could soon ignite in the U.S. and highlights the lack of research into the effects these products could have on our bodies. Just 26 studies reference heat-not-burn products, according to the press release. That's compared to the many thousands on tobacco, nicotine and cigarettes. Though the products are held to be less dangerous than cigarettes because they do not involve smoke, there's not a lot of research to back that up. The few studies of the device thus far agree, but with a caveat: Heating and inhaling tobacco in this manner still produces harmful chemicals. It might not harm you as much as a cigarette would, but it's still detrimental to your health. Philip Morris has been strongly critical of such research, going so far as to send letters to the heads of universities whose researchers published a study this year examining heat-not-burn products, reports the Washington Post. Those researchers refused to even talk to the paper. Fizzles and Starts Electronic devices that heat tobacco to produce vapor aren't a new idea, either. Similar products have been around since the 1980s, although consumers then weren't as excited, and the technology never took hold. Philip Morris developed a device called the Accord utilizing the same basic concept in the 90s, and rival RJ Reynolds attempted something similar with the Eclipse. Preliminary studies at the time found much the same thing as research today -- it might be a bit better for you, but it's not safe. Philip Morris points to its own research into the matter -- carried out at its glittering new facility in Switzerland -- showing the relative merits of devices like the IQOS and highlighting the lowered levels of chemicals. The study that attracted their ire last year, from Swiss researchers, showed higher levels of most dangerous chemicals than the company reported in its own work, though. Controversy notwithstanding, the IQOS seems poised to appeal to a market of younger customers wary of cigarettes but open to alternative forms of nicotine consumption. A 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human Services found that vaping had surpassed cigarette use among younger users, and those totals will likely rise. Heat-not-burn products, with their slick packaging and nominally healthier technology, could find a solid foothold here as well. Ayers' report doesn't necessarily recommend banning or even heavily restricting the devices. It's instead a warning to researchers that the data is lagging behind the cultural zeitgeist. Tobacco companies have a well-established history of lying to consumers and promising healthier alternatives -- for example, \"light cigarettes\" -- and the same could happen here. With indications that these devices are still harmful, though not as much as cigarettes, consumers are at risk of being deceived by marketing campaigns that take advantage of a lack of context and murky research to push an unsafe product. There's also a debate to be had about whether promoting a product that's a little safer versus pursuing complete eradication is best. There's no definitive answer for that question when it comes to smoking yet, in part because we don't even have the data to begin looking at it clearly.", "summary": "The IQOS smokeless tobacco product.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available.

Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for HIV is \"a good thing, regardless of who he is.\" Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this article.

Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em> How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long did it last?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals develop their gender identity. It&rsquo;s something that may evolve throughout a person&rsquo;s lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation and class.</p>\n<p>For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the &ldquo;pronoun check&rdquo; posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take.</p>\n<p>My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used &ldquo;they/them&rdquo; pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using &ldquo;he&rdquo; pronouns and physically transitioning. I made this decision with the understanding that I wasn&rsquo;t transitioning because I identified as a &ldquo;man&rdquo; per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, I&rsquo;ve passed as male about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!) When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say &ldquo;non-binary,&rdquo; and that my pronouns are &ldquo;he or they &mdash; either as fine.&rdquo; I am leaning into presenting as femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine, because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didn&rsquo;t initially know what being transgender meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there is a lot of information and help available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities. For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help people navigate the name and gender marker change process.</p>\n<p>One side effect that I didn&rsquo;t entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, &ldquo;Will people here be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?&rdquo; As a white and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership &mdash; and that of their successors in our movements &mdash; must be recognized.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Did you have, or do you currently have, any regrets about transitioning?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>What I think this question is getting at is, &ldquo;How do you know you&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; This was a question that I asked myself many times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes to my body. My answer to that is: I didn&rsquo;t truly know it was right until after I did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, &ldquo;Why on earth would you do something so permanent if you weren&rsquo;t sure?&rdquo; But It took a leap of faith. And, as someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesn&rsquo;t feel right, you know. It is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to stop your physical transition, you don&rsquo;t need to think of it as &ldquo;de-transitioning.&rdquo; The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>How has transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem and mental health?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient. Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power of our community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>What advice would you give to other people who want to follow the path you did?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there are no rules! You don&rsquo;t have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition. You&rsquo;re in the driver&rsquo;s seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms you will occupy it.</p>\n<p><em>This article is part of our 2021 Youth Pride Issue in partnership with <a data-id=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\" data-type=\"URL\" href=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\">Urban Health Media</a>. </em></p>", "date": "2017-12-23T00:00:00Z", "image": {"focal_point": "Smart"}, "original_link": "https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/", "summary": "For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending!

A: Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there are no rules! You dont have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition. Youre in the drivers seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms you will occupy it. This article is part of our 2021 Youth Pride Issue in partnership with Urban Health Media.", "summary": "For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using \"he\" pronouns and physically transitioning. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, Ive passed as male about 90% of the time. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget.", "keyword": ["changes", "body", "teens", "person", "lot", "trans", "suicidal", "physically", "study", "lgb", "pronouns", "gender", "transition", "transitioning"], "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/"}}

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added.

While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use.

Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em> How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long did it last?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals develop their gender identity. It&rsquo;s something that may evolve throughout a person&rsquo;s lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation and class.</p>\n<p>For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the &ldquo;pronoun check&rdquo; posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take.</p>\n<p>My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used &ldquo;they/them&rdquo; pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using &ldquo;he&rdquo; pronouns and physically transitioning. I made this decision with the understanding that I wasn&rsquo;t transitioning because I identified as a &ldquo;man&rdquo; per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, I&rsquo;ve passed as male about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!) When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say &ldquo;non-binary,&rdquo; and that my pronouns are &ldquo;he or they &mdash; either as fine.&rdquo; I am leaning into presenting as femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine, because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didn&rsquo;t initially know what being transgender meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there is a lot of information and help available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities. For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help people navigate the name and gender marker change process.</p>\n<p>One side effect that I didn&rsquo;t entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, &ldquo;Will people here be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?&rdquo; As a white and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership &mdash; and that of their successors in our movements &mdash; must be recognized.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Did you have, or do you currently have, any regrets about transitioning?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>What I think this question is getting at is, &ldquo;How do you know you&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; This was a question that I asked myself many times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes to my body. My answer to that is: I didn&rsquo;t truly know it was right until after I did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, &ldquo;Why on earth would you do something so permanent if you weren&rsquo;t sure?&rdquo; But It took a leap of faith. And, as someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesn&rsquo;t feel right, you know. It is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to stop your physical transition, you don&rsquo;t need to think of it as &ldquo;de-transitioning.&rdquo; The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>How has transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem and mental health?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient. Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power of our community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>What advice would you give to other people who want to follow the path you did?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there are no rules! You don&rsquo;t have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition. You&rsquo;re in the driver&rsquo;s seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms you will occupy it.</p>\n<p><em>This article is part of our 2021 Youth Pride Issue in partnership with <a data-id=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\" data-type=\"URL\" href=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\">Urban Health Media</a>. </em></p>", "date": "2017-12-23T00:00:00Z", "image": {"focal_point": "Smart"}, "original_link": "https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/", "summary": "For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending!

So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?&quot;</p>\n<p>The study was <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0215-9\">published online</a> January 29 in <em>npj Digital Medicine</em>.</p>\n<p>Intelligent virtual assistants &mdash; including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby &mdash; are transforming how the public seeks and finds information.</p>\n<p>Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result.</p>\n<p>&quot;There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,&quot; Ayers said. &quot;So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.&quot;</p>\n<p>The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment.</p>\n<p>Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2500043\">A recent investigation</a> of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30181110-patient-and-consumer-safety-risks-when-using-conversational-assistants-for-medical-information-an-observational-study-of-siri-alexa-and-google-assistant/?dopt=Abstract\">Another investigation</a> showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies.</p>\n<p>&quot;Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,&quot; said Ayers.</p>\n<p>&quot;So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English.</p>\n<p>Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit&hellip;' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries.</p>\n<p>&quot;We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer &mdash; calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,&quot; said Ayers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(18)30064-3/fulltext\">Recent studies</a> indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim.</p>\n<p>Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria:</p>\n<ul> <li><p>Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries?</p></li> </ul>\n<ul> <li><p>Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service?</p></li> </ul>\n<h3> <b>Virtually Useless Responses</b> </h3>\n<p>The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as &quot;Did I say something wrong?&quot;</p>\n<p>Specifically, when the five devices were asked &quot;Help me quit drugs,&quot; only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term &quot;drugs.&quot; No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result.</p>\n<p>All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to &quot;Help me quit pot,&quot; the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer.</p>\n<p>Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to &quot;Help me quit smoking&quot; or &quot;Help me quit tobacco,&quot; the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app.</p>\n<p>Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives.</p>\n<p>For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW.</p>\n<p>Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals.</p>\n<p>The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted.</p>\n<p>&quot;If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the findings for <em>Medscape Medical News</em>, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise.</p>\n<p>&quot;Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,&quot; said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>&quot;There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error.</p>\n<p>&quot;Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,&quot; Bickmore added.</p>\n<p>For his part, Ayers remained optimistic.</p>\n<p>&quot;At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit.</p>\n<p>&quot;Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,&quot; Ayers said.</p>\n<p><em>This study was supported by the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program.

Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

However, a team of California researchers says these virtual assistants have the the potential to help individuals fight addiction -- but they're not there yet. Investigators examined some of today's most popular intelligent virtual assistants and overwhelmingly found the devices failed to provide useful information in response to queries for addiction help. In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful. \"Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,\" study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego in La Jolla. \"Nevertheless, I don't want to look at these results and say this is a tragedy,\" Ayers told Medscape Medical News. \"What we're trying to do is shine the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants.

Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited.

While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for HIV is \"a good thing, regardless of who he is.\" Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this article.

Worldwide, there were 36.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS in 2015--the year Sheen made his announcement. But one epidemiologist notes that Sheen's disclosure may have had a hugely positive effect on HIV awareness. Last year, Dr. John W. Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at San Diego State University, was studying Google searches and news articles during the period around Sheen's announcement. His study, which appeared in JAMA Internal Medicine noted, unsurprisingly, that the number of searches and news stories involving the terms\"HIV\" showed a dramatic uptick in the days following Sheen's announcement. That's hardly a shock. Sheen's admission that he was HIV-positive was covered extensively. But there was another interesting uptick in the HIV-related search terms. Not only did people search more for \"HIV,\" people also searched more for \"HIV\" and \"symptoms,\" \"signs of,\" and \"testing.\" Ayers hypothesized that Sheen's disclosure might actually have had a positive effect on HIV awareness, encouraging people to get tested themselves. In an email to New York Magazine, Ayers was unequivocal: \"Sheens disclosure is the most significant domestic HIV-prevention event in the last decade, even though it was unplanned and was not framed as a public-health event.\" Now, there's even more reason to think that Sheen's disclosure had a positive effect. Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in Prevention Science. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says \"OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheens disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... \" Just look at the jump in sales. This graph comes directly from the study: The first graph shows the remarkable jump in sales right around Sheen's disclosure. The second graph compares the effect of Sheen's disclosure on OraQuick sales with the effect of World AIDS Day. The study notes that \"excess OraQuick sales following Sheens disclosure were equivalent to about 7 World Aids Days.\" What's OraQuick? OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently available, according to the CDC, who write \"The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 infected people may test false-negative with this test.\" Getting tested regularly for HIV and other STIs is hugely important.

Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em> How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long did it last?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals develop their gender identity. It&rsquo;s something that may evolve throughout a person&rsquo;s lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation and class.</p>\n<p>For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the &ldquo;pronoun check&rdquo; posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take.</p>\n<p>My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used &ldquo;they/them&rdquo; pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using &ldquo;he&rdquo; pronouns and physically transitioning. I made this decision with the understanding that I wasn&rsquo;t transitioning because I identified as a &ldquo;man&rdquo; per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, I&rsquo;ve passed as male about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!) When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say &ldquo;non-binary,&rdquo; and that my pronouns are &ldquo;he or they &mdash; either as fine.&rdquo; I am leaning into presenting as femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine, because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didn&rsquo;t initially know what being transgender meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there is a lot of information and help available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities. For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help people navigate the name and gender marker change process.</p>\n<p>One side effect that I didn&rsquo;t entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, &ldquo;Will people here be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?&rdquo; As a white and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership &mdash; and that of their successors in our movements &mdash; must be recognized.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Did you have, or do you currently have, any regrets about transitioning?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>What I think this question is getting at is, &ldquo;How do you know you&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; This was a question that I asked myself many times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes to my body. My answer to that is: I didn&rsquo;t truly know it was right until after I did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, &ldquo;Why on earth would you do something so permanent if you weren&rsquo;t sure?&rdquo; But It took a leap of faith. And, as someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesn&rsquo;t feel right, you know. It is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to stop your physical transition, you don&rsquo;t need to think of it as &ldquo;de-transitioning.&rdquo; The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>How has transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem and mental health?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient. Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power of our community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>What advice would you give to other people who want to follow the path you did?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there are no rules! You don&rsquo;t have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition. You&rsquo;re in the driver&rsquo;s seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms you will occupy it.</p>\n<p><em>This article is part of our 2021 Youth Pride Issue in partnership with <a data-id=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\" data-type=\"URL\" href=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\">Urban Health Media</a>. </em></p>", "date": "2017-12-23T00:00:00Z", "image": {"focal_point": "Smart"}, "original_link": "https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/", "summary": "For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending!

However, a team of California researchers says these virtual assistants have the the potential to help individuals fight addiction &mdash; but they're not there yet.</p>\n<p>Investigators examined some of today's most popular intelligent virtual assistants and overwhelmingly found the devices failed to provide useful information in response to queries for addiction help. In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful.</p>\n<p>&quot;Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,&quot; study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego in La Jolla.</p>\n<p>&quot;Nevertheless, I don't want to look at these results and say this is a tragedy,&quot; Ayers told <em>Medscape Medical News. </em>&quot;What we're trying to do is shine the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants. So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?&quot;</p>\n<p>The study was <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0215-9\">published online</a> January 29 in <em>npj Digital Medicine</em>.</p>\n<p>Intelligent virtual assistants &mdash; including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby &mdash; are transforming how the public seeks and finds information.</p>\n<p>Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result.</p>\n<p>&quot;There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,&quot; Ayers said. &quot;So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.&quot;</p>\n<p>The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment.</p>\n<p>Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2500043\">A recent investigation</a> of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30181110-patient-and-consumer-safety-risks-when-using-conversational-assistants-for-medical-information-an-observational-study-of-siri-alexa-and-google-assistant/?dopt=Abstract\">Another investigation</a> showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies.</p>\n<p>&quot;Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,&quot; said Ayers.</p>\n<p>&quot;So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English.</p>\n<p>Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit&hellip;' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries.</p>\n<p>&quot;We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer &mdash; calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,&quot; said Ayers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(18)30064-3/fulltext\">Recent studies</a> indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim.</p>\n<p>Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria:</p>\n<ul> <li><p>Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries?</p></li> </ul>\n<ul> <li><p>Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service?</p></li> </ul>\n<h3> <b>Virtually Useless Responses</b> </h3>\n<p>The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as &quot;Did I say something wrong?&quot;</p>\n<p>Specifically, when the five devices were asked &quot;Help me quit drugs,&quot; only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term &quot;drugs.&quot; No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result.</p>\n<p>All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to &quot;Help me quit pot,&quot; the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer.</p>\n<p>Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to &quot;Help me quit smoking&quot; or &quot;Help me quit tobacco,&quot; the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app.</p>\n<p>Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives.</p>\n<p>For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW.</p>\n<p>Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals.</p>\n<p>The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted.</p>\n<p>&quot;If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the findings for <em>Medscape Medical News</em>, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise.</p>\n<p>&quot;Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,&quot; said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>&quot;There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error.</p>\n<p>&quot;Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error.

In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful. \"Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,\" study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego in La Jolla. \"Nevertheless, I don't want to look at these results and say this is a tragedy,\" Ayers told Medscape Medical News. \"What we're trying to do is shine the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants. So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?\" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added.

Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added.

While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap.

Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at San Diego State University, was studying Google searches and news articles during the period around Sheen's announcement. His study, which appeared in <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2495274\">JAMA Internal Medicine </a>noted, unsurprisingly, that the number of searches and news stories involving the terms&quot;HIV&quot; showed a dramatic uptick in the days following Sheen's announcement. That's hardly a shock. Sheen's admission that he was HIV-positive was covered extensively.</p>\n<p>But there was another interesting uptick in the HIV-related search terms. Not only did people search more for &quot;HIV,&quot; people also searched more for &quot;HIV&quot; and &quot;symptoms,&quot; &quot;signs of,&quot; and &quot;testing.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ayers hypothesized that Sheen's disclosure might actually have had a positive effect on HIV awareness, encouraging people to get tested themselves.</p>\n<p>In an email to New York Magazine, Ayers was <a href=\"https://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/charlie-sheen-may-have-accidentally-saved-some-lives-with-his-hiv-announcement.html\">unequivocal</a>: &ldquo;Sheen&rsquo;s disclosure is the most significant domestic HIV-prevention event in the last decade, even though it was unplanned and was not framed as a public-health event.&quot;</p>\n<h2>Now, there's even more reason to think that Sheen's disclosure had a positive effect.</h2>\n<p>Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11121-017-0792-2\">Prevention Science</a>. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says &quot;OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheen&rsquo;s disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... &quot;</p>\n<h2>Just look at the jump in sales.</h2>\n<p>This graph comes directly from the study:</p>\n<figure><video src=\"https://static.attn.com/sites/default/files/11121_2017_792_Fig1_HTML.gif?auto=format&crop=faces&fit=crop&q=60&fm=mp4&w=768&ixlib=js-1.1.0\"></video></figure>\n<p>The first graph shows the remarkable jump in sales right around Sheen's disclosure. The second graph compares the effect of Sheen's disclosure on OraQuick sales with the effect of World AIDS Day. The study notes that &quot;excess OraQuick sales following Sheen&rsquo;s disclosure were equivalent to about 7 World Aids Days.&quot;</p>\n<h2>What's OraQuick?</h2>\n<p>OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently available, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/hometests.html\">CDC</a>, who write &quot;The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 infected people may test false-negative with this test.&quot;</p>\n<h2>Getting tested regularly for HIV and other STIs is hugely important.</h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/hivtesting.html\">CDC</a>, of the 850,000&ndash;950,000 individuals living with HIV in the United States, &quot;one fourth of individuals living with HIV are unaware that they have the virus.&quot; And people who are unaware that they have HIV present a twofold problem.</p>\n<p>First, those who do not know they are HIV positive do not seek treatment&mdash;and anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to dramatically increase the life expectancy of HIV patients. In terms of the success of this therapy, also known as the AIDS &quot;cocktail,&quot; early detection is key.

But one epidemiologist notes that Sheen's disclosure may have had a hugely positive effect on HIV awareness. Last year, Dr. John W. Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at San Diego State University, was studying Google searches and news articles during the period around Sheen's announcement. His study, which appeared in JAMA Internal Medicine noted, unsurprisingly, that the number of searches and news stories involving the terms\"HIV\" showed a dramatic uptick in the days following Sheen's announcement. That's hardly a shock. Sheen's admission that he was HIV-positive was covered extensively. But there was another interesting uptick in the HIV-related search terms. Not only did people search more for \"HIV,\" people also searched more for \"HIV\" and \"symptoms,\" \"signs of,\" and \"testing.\" Ayers hypothesized that Sheen's disclosure might actually have had a positive effect on HIV awareness, encouraging people to get tested themselves. In an email to New York Magazine, Ayers was unequivocal: \"Sheens disclosure is the most significant domestic HIV-prevention event in the last decade, even though it was unplanned and was not framed as a public-health event.\" Now, there's even more reason to think that Sheen's disclosure had a positive effect. Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in Prevention Science. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says \"OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheens disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... \" Just look at the jump in sales. This graph comes directly from the study: The first graph shows the remarkable jump in sales right around Sheen's disclosure. The second graph compares the effect of Sheen's disclosure on OraQuick sales with the effect of World AIDS Day. The study notes that \"excess OraQuick sales following Sheens disclosure were equivalent to about 7 World Aids Days.\" What's OraQuick? OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently available, according to the CDC, who write \"The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 infected people may test false-negative with this test.\" Getting tested regularly for HIV and other STIs is hugely important. According to the CDC, of the 850,000-950,000 individuals living with HIV in the United States, \"one fourth of individuals living with HIV are unaware that they have the virus.\" And people who are unaware that they have HIV present a twofold problem. First, those who do not know they are HIV positive do not seek treatment--and anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to dramatically increase the life expectancy of HIV patients. In terms of the success of this therapy, also known as the AIDS \"cocktail,\" early detection is key. According to Medwiser, HIV patients who are treated early will live an average of 11 years longer. Second, those who are unaware of their status cannot take steps to ensure that they do not pass the virus on to others, compounding the scourge of the epidemic. So go get tested.

Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said. This study was supported by the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program. Ayers and Bickmore have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. npj Digital Medicine.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added.

While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus.

According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for HIV is \"a good thing, regardless of who he is.\" Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this article. She is an anesthesiology resident at Massachusetts General Hospital and part of the ABC News medical unit.", "summary": "According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement. Still, in the wake of the nation's recent spate of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping, a similarly unregulated product, Ayers thinks CBD's online popularity should serve as a call to action for regulators. \"We already saw what can happen with vaping,\" he said. \"Imagine with the demand for CBD, if we have a tainted product out there.\"", "date": "2019-10-23T00:00:00Z", "image": {"focal_point": "Smart"}, "original_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514", "summary": "Searches for CBD spiked this year as awareness of the product grew.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats.

Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added.

In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful. \"Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,\" study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego in La Jolla. \"Nevertheless, I don't want to look at these results and say this is a tragedy,\" Ayers told Medscape Medical News. \"What we're trying to do is shine the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants. So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?\" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said. This study was supported by the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program. Ayers and Bickmore have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. npj Digital Medicine.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added.

While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement.

However, a team of California researchers says these virtual assistants have the the potential to help individuals fight addiction -- but they're not there yet. Investigators examined some of today's most popular intelligent virtual assistants and overwhelmingly found the devices failed to provide useful information in response to queries for addiction help. In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful. \"Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,\" study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego in La Jolla. \"Nevertheless, I don't want to look at these results and say this is a tragedy,\" Ayers told Medscape Medical News. \"What we're trying to do is shine the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants. So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?\" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice.

Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said. This study was supported by the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program. Ayers and Bickmore have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. npj Digital Medicine.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week.

According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for HIV is \"a good thing, regardless of who he is.\" Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this article. She is an anesthesiology resident at Massachusetts General Hospital and part of the ABC News medical unit.", "summary": "According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level.

However, a team of California researchers says these virtual assistants have the the potential to help individuals fight addiction -- but they're not there yet. Investigators examined some of today's most popular intelligent virtual assistants and overwhelmingly found the devices failed to provide useful information in response to queries for addiction help. In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful. \"Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,\" study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego in La Jolla. \"Nevertheless, I don't want to look at these results and say this is a tragedy,\" Ayers told Medscape Medical News. \"What we're trying to do is shine the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants. So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?\" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement. Still, in the wake of the nation's recent spate of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping, a similarly unregulated product, Ayers thinks CBD's online popularity should serve as a call to action for regulators. \"We already saw what can happen with vaping,\" he said. \"Imagine with the demand for CBD, if we have a tainted product out there.\"", "date": "2019-10-23T00:00:00Z", "image": {"focal_point": "Smart"}, "original_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514", "summary": "Searches for CBD spiked this year as awareness of the product grew.

Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space.

The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question.

Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap.

However, a team of California researchers says these virtual assistants have the the potential to help individuals fight addiction -- but they're not there yet. Investigators examined some of today's most popular intelligent virtual assistants and overwhelmingly found the devices failed to provide useful information in response to queries for addiction help. In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful. \"Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,\" study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego in La Jolla. \"Nevertheless, I don't want to look at these results and say this is a tragedy,\" Ayers told Medscape Medical News. \"What we're trying to do is shine the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants. So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?\" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus.

However, a team of California researchers says these virtual assistants have the the potential to help individuals fight addiction -- but they're not there yet. Investigators examined some of today's most popular intelligent virtual assistants and overwhelmingly found the devices failed to provide useful information in response to queries for addiction help. In fact, only 4 of 70 help-seeking queries to five of the most popular devices returned singular responses, only one of which was even slightly helpful. \"Most of the time, the responses reflected the device's confusion,\" study investigator John W. Ayers, PhD, MA, of the Center for Data Driven Health at Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego in La Jolla. \"Nevertheless, I don't want to look at these results and say this is a tragedy,\" Ayers told Medscape Medical News. \"What we're trying to do is shine the light on a way that tech companies can get involved in health when it comes to smart devices and intelligent virtual assistants. So we want to point out to them that there's a right answer to the questions we asked, so why not promote them?\" The study was published online January 29 in npj Digital Medicine. Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries? Was the singular response linked to an available treatment or treatment referral service? Virtually Useless Responses The study showed that of the 70 different help-seeking queries, the virtual assistants returned actionable responses only 4 times. The most common response was one of confusion, such as \"Did I say something wrong?\" Specifically, when the five devices were asked \"Help me quit drugs,\" only Amazon Alexa provided a singular response, but only defined the term \"drugs.\" No other virtual assistant provided a singular response to the query. Interestingly, the results were similar regardless of the substance cited. All responses for alcohol and opioids across all devices failed to return a singular result. All marijuana-related queries, with one exception, failed to return a singular result from any device. When Apple's Siri was asked to \"Help me quit pot,\" the device directed users to a local marijuana retailer. Only two of 25 tobacco-related queries returned singular results, both with Google Assistant. When asked to \"Help me quit smoking\" or \"Help me quit tobacco,\" the device linked users to Dr. QuitNow, a mobile smoking cessation app. Given these findings, the researchers concluded that intelligent virtual assistants currently offer little, or no, assistance for those seeking addiction help. This, they said, represents a significant missed opportunity for the devices to play an increasingly meaningful role in people's lives. For example, when asked to help with smoking cessation, a virtual assistant can respond by calling a toll-free telephone counseling service such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW. Similar responses could be generated for other queries related to various types of substances abused, including directing individuals to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (1-800-662-HELP) for other addiction treatment referrals. The potential impact of enabling intelligent virtual assistants in this way is significant, Ayers noted. \"If you look at political debate today, there's a question of how these tech monopolies are giving back. So here's a way that tech companies can give back to society in a very meaningful way for problems that are easily solvable,\" he said. Potential for Good Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Timothy W. Bickmore, PhD, who was not involved with the study, said the findings come as no surprise. \"Even if developers programmed in well-designed responses to requests for help, there is no guarantee people would ask for help in exactly the prescribed manner,\" said Bickmore, from the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \"There are two fundamental [and insurmountable] problems to having conversational assistants provide any kind of medical advice. One, people have no idea what their capabilities are, and this can only be discovered through trial and error. \"Two, there is no way for these systems to recognize the full range of unconstrained natural language without error. These issues are compounded by errors in speech recognition,\" Bickmore added. For his part, Ayers remained optimistic. \"At the end of the day, I think there's capacity for these companies and their devices to help. They spend time and money on a lot of outcomes that have no potential for public health benefit. \"Alexa knows how to fart. So why not take some of the time that we spend on teaching Alexa to fart and let's help people who are desperately seeking help for their substance use problems,\" Ayers said.

Changing the Digital Landscape Intelligent virtual assistants -- including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby -- are transforming how the public seeks and finds information. Traditional internet search engines can return millions of results in response to a specific query, prompting users to collate the results and reach their own conclusions. Intelligent virtual assistants, on the other hand, are designed to return a singular result. \"There's a tremendous benefit to having a singular correct answer,\" Ayers said. \"So there's all this potential for these devices to be used for help.\" The appeal of virtual assistants has not gone unnoticed by the public. Almost half of American adults already use intelligent virtual assistants for myriad tasks, queries, and entertainment. Yet one realm largely overlooked by device manufacturers is public health. A recent investigation of smartphones showed the devices inconsistently recognized suicide-related queries, and failed to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Another investigation showed that when asked a variety of health-related queries, intelligent virtual assistants actually directed users to take action that had the potential to result in harm or death. Nevertheless, many device manufacturers seem poised to roll out healthcare advice, including personalized wellness strategies. \"Companies like Amazon and Apple have talked about how they're moving into the healthcare space. For example, there are several healthcare centers in the US where Alexa [devices] are actually kept in hospital inpatient rooms as an aid to care,\" said Ayers. \"So in this era where these devices are used to help, we wanted to determine their utility, and one way we can do so is through this case study,\" he added. The researchers investigated the five intelligent virtual assistants, which represent 99% of the marketplace for such devices. Each device's operating software was up to date at the time of the study in January 2019, and the language was set to US English. Each query was prefaced by 'Help me quit...' followed by either a generic or a substance-specific request such as alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or opioids. Fourteen queries were posed to each of the five virtual assistants, a total of 70 queries. \"We asked these questions because there's already an established norm regarding the one correct answer -- calling the free, federally sponsored 1-800 hotline for the addiction in question. You can call those numbers and get free treatment or free treatment referral to match your insurance or at a cost you can afford,\" said Ayers. Recent studies indicate that virtual assistants may struggle to comprehend medical terms, so two different study investigators, both of whom were native English speakers, spoke each query. The virtual assistants' responses were recorded verbatim. Responses were assessed according to two primary criteria: Did the intelligent virtual assistant provide a singular response to the addiction help-seeking queries?

Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available.

Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week.

Worldwide, there were 36.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS in 2015--the year Sheen made his announcement. But one epidemiologist notes that Sheen's disclosure may have had a hugely positive effect on HIV awareness. Last year, Dr. John W. Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at San Diego State University, was studying Google searches and news articles during the period around Sheen's announcement. His study, which appeared in JAMA Internal Medicine noted, unsurprisingly, that the number of searches and news stories involving the terms\"HIV\" showed a dramatic uptick in the days following Sheen's announcement. That's hardly a shock. Sheen's admission that he was HIV-positive was covered extensively. But there was another interesting uptick in the HIV-related search terms. Not only did people search more for \"HIV,\" people also searched more for \"HIV\" and \"symptoms,\" \"signs of,\" and \"testing.\" Ayers hypothesized that Sheen's disclosure might actually have had a positive effect on HIV awareness, encouraging people to get tested themselves. In an email to New York Magazine, Ayers was unequivocal: \"Sheens disclosure is the most significant domestic HIV-prevention event in the last decade, even though it was unplanned and was not framed as a public-health event.\" Now, there's even more reason to think that Sheen's disclosure had a positive effect. Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in Prevention Science. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says \"OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheens disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... \" Just look at the jump in sales. This graph comes directly from the study: The first graph shows the remarkable jump in sales right around Sheen's disclosure. The second graph compares the effect of Sheen's disclosure on OraQuick sales with the effect of World AIDS Day. The study notes that \"excess OraQuick sales following Sheens disclosure were equivalent to about 7 World Aids Days.\" What's OraQuick? OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently available, according to the CDC, who write \"The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 infected people may test false-negative with this test.\" Getting tested regularly for HIV and other STIs is hugely important. According to the CDC, of the 850,000-950,000 individuals living with HIV in the United States, \"one fourth of individuals living with HIV are unaware that they have the virus.\" And people who are unaware that they have HIV present a twofold problem. First, those who do not know they are HIV positive do not seek treatment--and anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to dramatically increase the life expectancy of HIV patients. In terms of the success of this therapy, also known as the AIDS \"cocktail,\" early detection is key. According to Medwiser, HIV patients who are treated early will live an average of 11 years longer. Second, those who are unaware of their status cannot take steps to ensure that they do not pass the virus on to others, compounding the scourge of the epidemic. So go get tested.

In an email to New York Magazine, Ayers was unequivocal: \"Sheens disclosure is the most significant domestic HIV-prevention event in the last decade, even though it was unplanned and was not framed as a public-health event.\" Now, there's even more reason to think that Sheen's disclosure had a positive effect. Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in Prevention Science. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says \"OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheens disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... \" Just look at the jump in sales. This graph comes directly from the study: The first graph shows the remarkable jump in sales right around Sheen's disclosure. The second graph compares the effect of Sheen's disclosure on OraQuick sales with the effect of World AIDS Day. The study notes that \"excess OraQuick sales following Sheens disclosure were equivalent to about 7 World Aids Days.\" What's OraQuick? OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently available, according to the CDC, who write \"The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 infected people may test false-negative with this test.\" Getting tested regularly for HIV and other STIs is hugely important. According to the CDC, of the 850,000-950,000 individuals living with HIV in the United States, \"one fourth of individuals living with HIV are unaware that they have the virus.\" And people who are unaware that they have HIV present a twofold problem. First, those who do not know they are HIV positive do not seek treatment--and anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to dramatically increase the life expectancy of HIV patients. In terms of the success of this therapy, also known as the AIDS \"cocktail,\" early detection is key. According to Medwiser, HIV patients who are treated early will live an average of 11 years longer. Second, those who are unaware of their status cannot take steps to ensure that they do not pass the virus on to others, compounding the scourge of the epidemic. So go get tested.

Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em> How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long did it last?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals develop their gender identity. It&rsquo;s something that may evolve throughout a person&rsquo;s lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation and class.</p>\n<p>For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the &ldquo;pronoun check&rdquo; posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take.</p>\n<p>My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used &ldquo;they/them&rdquo; pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using &ldquo;he&rdquo; pronouns and physically transitioning. I made this decision with the understanding that I wasn&rsquo;t transitioning because I identified as a &ldquo;man&rdquo; per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, I&rsquo;ve passed as male about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!) When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say &ldquo;non-binary,&rdquo; and that my pronouns are &ldquo;he or they &mdash; either as fine.&rdquo; I am leaning into presenting as femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine, because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didn&rsquo;t initially know what being transgender meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there is a lot of information and help available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities. For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help people navigate the name and gender marker change process.</p>\n<p>One side effect that I didn&rsquo;t entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, &ldquo;Will people here be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?&rdquo; As a white and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership &mdash; and that of their successors in our movements &mdash; must be recognized.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Did you have, or do you currently have, any regrets about transitioning?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>What I think this question is getting at is, &ldquo;How do you know you&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; This was a question that I asked myself many times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes to my body. My answer to that is: I didn&rsquo;t truly know it was right until after I did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, &ldquo;Why on earth would you do something so permanent if you weren&rsquo;t sure?&rdquo; But It took a leap of faith. And, as someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesn&rsquo;t feel right, you know. It is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to stop your physical transition, you don&rsquo;t need to think of it as &ldquo;de-transitioning.&rdquo; The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>How has transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem and mental health?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient. Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power of our community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>What advice would you give to other people who want to follow the path you did?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there are no rules! You don&rsquo;t have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition. You&rsquo;re in the driver&rsquo;s seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms you will occupy it.</p>\n<p><em>This article is part of our 2021 Youth Pride Issue in partnership with <a data-id=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\" data-type=\"URL\" href=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\">Urban Health Media</a>. </em></p>", "date": "2017-12-23T00:00:00Z", "image": {"focal_point": "Smart"}, "original_link": "https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/", "summary": "", "title": "", "content": "", "dir": "blade", "request_url": "https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/", "request_response_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616200004/https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/", "summary_title": "LGB teens more suicidal: study", "summary_description": "LGB teens are more likely to plan or commit suicide according to research published this week in the journal JAMA.

I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget.", "summary_article": "Miami and Baltimore- Urban Health Media Project reporter Vanessa Falcon, a high school student in Miami, interviewed Arin Jayes, 30, of Baltimore, about his gender identity journey and experience transitioning to a non-binary trans man. Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist. Q: How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long did it last? A: As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals develop their gender identity. Its something that may evolve throughout a persons lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation and class. For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the \"pronoun check\" posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take. My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used \"they/them\" pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using \"he\" pronouns and physically transitioning. I made this decision with the understanding that I wasnt transitioning because I identified as a \"man\" per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, Ive passed as male about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!) When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say \"non-binary,\" and that my pronouns are \"he or they -- either as fine.\" I am leaning into presenting as femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine, because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important. Q: Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why? A: Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didnt initially know what being transgender meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget. Luckily, there is a lot of information and help available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities. For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help people navigate the name and gender marker change process. One side effect that I didnt entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, \"Will people here be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?\" As a white and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership -- and that of their successors in our movements -- must be recognized. Q: Did you have, or do you currently have, any regrets about transitioning? A: What I think this question is getting at is, \"How do you know youre sure?\" This was a question that I asked myself many times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes to my body. My answer to that is: I didnt truly know it was right until after I did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, \"Why on earth would you do something so permanent if you werent sure?\" But It took a leap of faith. And, as someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesnt feel right, you know. It is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to stop your physical transition, you dont need to think of it as \"de-transitioning.\" The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots. Q: How has transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem and mental health? A: Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient. Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power of our community. Q: What advice would you give to other people who want to follow the path you did? A: Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there are no rules! You dont have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition. Youre in the drivers seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms you will occupy it.

Heat-not-burn cigarettes are battery-powered devices that take tobacco to the brink of combustion by heating tobacco leaves to around 500 degrees and producing an inhalable aerosol, researcher Theodore L. Caputi and colleagues wrote in a recent PLOS One-published study. The smoking alternative has exploded in Japan, where average monthly searches for heat-not-burn tobacco products rose 1,426 percent between 2015 and 2016, but clinicians are largely unaware of its cardiovascular risks. \"We do not know the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco,\" Caputi said in an email. \"While they are likely to be marketed--formally or informally--as 'healthier than cigarettes, there is insufficient evidence to make that claim. In itself, insufficient evidence is dangerous--tobacco companies have proven they wont wait until all the facts are in before they begin making health claims, and public health researchers need to fill in knowledge gaps quickly so that consumers can make well-informed decisions.\" Because of the public health implications of tobacco use, Caputi said, including the fact that nearly half of all smokers are estimated to die from a smoking-related illness, \"this is not a decision that consumers should take lightly.\" In his study, Caputi and four colleagues used Google search query data to analyze the rising popularity of heat-not-burn products. Because traditional surveys about smoking dont ask about heat-not-burn tobacco, and since the product has little visibility in U.S. markets, the researchers focused on search engine analysis to evaluate the scale and growth potential of the new trend. In Japan, they found, there are now between 5.9 and 7.5 million estimated heat-not-burn-related Google searches per month, based on estimates from September. After initial heat-not-burn products hit the Japanese market in 2015, spurring a nearly 1,500 percent peak in Google searches on the topic, related searches grew by an additional 100 percent during the next year. Caputi and colleagues compared search queries for heat-not-burn products in Japan to Google searches for e-cigarettes in the U.S., since e-cigarettes arent legal in Japan. Heat-not-burn searches occurred more frequently in Japan than e-cigarette searches did in the U.S., the authors reported, with the first queries for heat-not-burn cigarettes eclipsing e-cigarettes in April 2016. The popularity of e-cigarettes in the U.S. is waning, Caputi said in a September 2016 article published in the medical journal Tobacco Control. Whereas growth of the e-cig industry was predicted to rise 126 percent in 2016, new Euromonitor International statistics estimate the reality to be closer to 51 percent. E-cigarette users are becoming displeased with the taste of the product, he said, citing Wells Fargo tobacco analyst Bonnie Herzog. While consumers arent necessarily concerned with the health risks of the product, they notice a lag in gratification from e-cigarettes that isnt true for traditional cigarettes, which deliver nicotine to the bloodstream much more quickly. E-cigarettes also lack a \"throat hit,\" Caputi wrote, which many conventional tobacco users enjoy. Heat-not-burn products offer those feelings that e-cigarettes lack. \"The pervasiveness of e-cigarettes and spreading discontentment with the lack of a throat-hit may open the floodgate for heat-not-burns success,\" he wrote. Heat-not-burn cigarettes have been gradually introduced to an international market in more than 20 nations, including the United Kingdom, Russia, Korea, Switzerland and Italy, but the focal test market is Japan, Caputi and colleagues wrote in the PLOS One study. Japan Tobacco introduced its local heat-not-burn device, called Ploom TECH, in March 2016, and Philip Morris Internationals \"IQOS\" (\"I Quit Ordinary Smoking\") and British American Tobaccos \"Glo\" followed soon after. Now, PMI has entered the FDA approval process to start marketing and sales in the U.S. According to the Tobacco Control article, a Wells Fargo analyst predicted heat-not-burn products could displace up to 30 percent of the countrys combustible cigarette industry by 2025. Caputi wrote recent research has suggested heat-not-burn products are less harmful than combustible cigarettes, but other studies have shown risks of smoking heat-not-burn tobacco include carbon monoxide and formaldehyde exposure, as well as the potential for side-stream emissions. Reto Auer, MD, MAS, and colleagues found that PMIs IQOS releases smoke containing elements from pyrolysis and thermogenic degradation that mirror the components of traditional cigarette smoke. \"PMI claims that IQOS releases no smoke because the tobacco does not combust and the tobacco leaves are only heated, not burned,\" Auer and co-authors wrote in a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. \"However, there can be smoke without fire. Dancing around the definition of smoke to avoid indoor smoking bans is unethical.\" Now, Caputi said, is the time to act. In his PLOS One paper, he and co-authors wrote their findings were a \"clarion call\" for public health practitioners, who should expand heat-not-burn product surveillance, preemptively study the smoking alternatives risks and benefits and adjust health messaging about tobacco products.

Our new study shows not only did Sheen's disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention, it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales,&quot; Ayers said.</p>\n<p>Though they are not doctors, many celebrities have had both positive and negative ties to public health in recent years.</p>\n<h3>When celebrities open up about their health</h3>\n<p>&quot;The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV,&quot; said Steven Hoffman, scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab.</p>\n<p>In 1991, when most people didn't have much information about the virus and the Internet was not commonly used, the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/sports/2011/11/03/vault-magic-johnson-hiv.cnn\">American basketball star </a>announced that he had tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA.</p>\n<p>&quot;Here was a very prominent athlete who is publicly disclosing being HIV-positive and opening up conversation around it for people,&quot; said Hoffman, who was not involved in the latest study. &quot;I think that's an example highlighting the positive role that celebrity can play in informing health decisions.&quot;</p>\n<p>Yet while Johnson's HIV disclosure spurred questions and conversations, since the virus was still unfamiliar, Sheen's disclosure was linked to action, Ayers said.</p>\n<p>After Sheen's announcement, about 1.25 million people in the United States searched online for topics directly related to condoms, HIV symptoms or HIV testing, according to Ayers' previous study, published in the journal <a href=\"http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2495274\">JAMA Internal Medicine</a> last year.</p>\n<p>That study involved analyzing Google Trends and search term data from 2004 through November 2015, which included when Sheen disclosed his HIV status on November 17, 2015.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that Sheen's announcement corresponded with the greatest number of HIV-related Google searchers ever recorded in the US. But Sheen didn't make an immediate call to action for the public to get tested or use condoms, and public health groups didn't use him as a face to raise HIV awareness.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Sheen's disclosure was an example of how -- without the celebrity or public health leaders calling for action -- the public appeared to still respond based on health information that was widely known, Ayers said.</p>\n<p>&quot;When Magic Johnson made his disclosure, there wasn't a similar reaction. There couldn't be, because people didn't know what to do,&quot; Ayers said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Remember, people (were) asking, 'Can he play basketball?' 'Can I shake his hand?' There wasn't this trove of information about HIV, HIV prevention and HIV testing. When Sheen disclosed, there was this trove of information,&quot; he said. &quot;We saw people seeking out information on the signs of HIV, HIV testing and how to prevent HIV by using condoms. We saw this trilogy of reaction that is fairly consistent with what public health has been promoting for 20-plus years.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kami Kosenko, an associate professor of health communication at North Carolina State University, said that she believes actress Angelina Jolie's 2013 announcement of <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/14/showbiz/angelina-jolie-double-mastectomy/\">a double mastectomy</a> to prevent breast cancer also had a positive influence on public health, despite possibly influencing an uptick in unnecessary genetic testing.</p>\n<p>Jolie said she made her decision because <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/14/health/jolie-what-is-brca/\">she has a mutation in her BRCA1 gene</a>.

Unfortunately, we do not share the same resources as these famous 'friends,' which impacts our ability to follow celebrity health advice,&quot; she said. &quot;For example, at the time of Jolie's announcement, the genetic tests she underwent were prohibitively expensive for the average American.&quot;</p>\n<p>There are examples of celebrities having a potentially harmful influence on public health too, said Hoffman, director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab.</p>\n<h3>'I do blame celebrities'</h3>\n<p>&quot;The most prominent example of harm would be, in my mind, Jenny McCarthy,&quot; Hoffman said.</p>\n<p>The American actress has been a vocal autism activist, spreading concerns that autism might be associated with childhood vaccines.</p>\n<p>McCarthy was unavailable for comment, but her representative said she addressed her stance on vaccines in an op-ed published in the Chicago Sun-Times in 2014, headlined &quot;The gray area on vaccines.&quot;</p>\n<p>Her son, Evan, was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/24/jenny.autism/index.html?_s=PM:US\">diagnosed with autism</a>.

Just look at what happened after Charlie Sheen's HIV disclosure two years ago, said John Ayers , a research professor at San Diego State University. Sales of in-home HIV testing kits reached record highs around the same time the actor announced that he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2015, according to a study published in the journal Prevention Science on Thursday. Ayers was a co-author of the study. About the same time, \"in record numbers, people were going online, seeking out information on what the signs of HIV are, on how to find and appropriately prevent HIV with devices such as condoms and also how to get tested,'\" Ayers said. \"We've seen this ... many times over.\" For the new study, Ayers and his co-authors monitored weekly sales of OraQuick, the only FDA-approved at-home oral HIV testing kit available in the United States, from 2014 to 2016. The researchers found that there were 8,225 more sales than they expected the week of Sheen's HIV status announcement. Elevated sales continued for four weeks after Sheen's disclosure. The findings show a correlation, not a direct causation. Yet in a previous study, Ayers and his colleagues also found that Google searches for HIV testing and related topics also spiked after Sheen's announcement. \"The most common reaction is, 'So what? What does a search really mean?' Our new study shows not only did Sheen's disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention, it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales,\" Ayers said. Though they are not doctors, many celebrities have had both positive and negative ties to public health in recent years. When celebrities open up about their health \"The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV,\" said Steven Hoffman, scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab.

When celebrities open up about their health \"The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV,\" said Steven Hoffman, scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. In 1991, when most people didn't have much information about the virus and the Internet was not commonly used, the American basketball star announced that he had tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA. \"Here was a very prominent athlete who is publicly disclosing being HIV-positive and opening up conversation around it for people,\" said Hoffman, who was not involved in the latest study. \"I think that's an example highlighting the positive role that celebrity can play in informing health decisions.\" Yet while Johnson's HIV disclosure spurred questions and conversations, since the virus was still unfamiliar, Sheen's disclosure was linked to action, Ayers said. After Sheen's announcement, about 1.25 million people in the United States searched online for topics directly related to condoms, HIV symptoms or HIV testing, according to Ayers' previous study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine last year. That study involved analyzing Google Trends and search term data from 2004 through November 2015, which included when Sheen disclosed his HIV status on November 17, 2015. The researchers found that Sheen's announcement corresponded with the greatest number of HIV-related Google searchers ever recorded in the US. But Sheen didn't make an immediate call to action for the public to get tested or use condoms, and public health groups didn't use him as a face to raise HIV awareness.

MUST WATCH Celebrities who changed the face of HIV 01:08 Therefore, Sheen's disclosure was an example of how -- without the celebrity or public health leaders calling for action -- the public appeared to still respond based on health information that was widely known, Ayers said. \"When Magic Johnson made his disclosure, there wasn't a similar reaction. There couldn't be, because people didn't know what to do,\" Ayers said. \"Remember, people (were) asking, 'Can he play basketball?' 'Can I shake his hand?' There wasn't this trove of information about HIV, HIV prevention and HIV testing. When Sheen disclosed, there was this trove of information,\" he said. \"We saw people seeking out information on the signs of HIV, HIV testing and how to prevent HIV by using condoms. We saw this trilogy of reaction that is fairly consistent with what public health has been promoting for 20-plus years.\" JUST WATCHED The 'Angelina effect' on cancer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The 'Angelina effect' on cancer 02:22 Kami Kosenko, an associate professor of health communication at North Carolina State University, said that she believes actress Angelina Jolie's 2013 announcement of a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer also had a positive influence on public health, despite possibly influencing an uptick in unnecessary genetic testing. Kosenko led a study in which 229 women were surveyed immediately after Jolie's announcement to undergo a double mastectomy. Researchers looked at whether Jolie influenced the women's genetic testing intentions. JUST WATCHED Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion 06:07 The study, published in the Journal of Health Communication last year, showed that 30% of the women intended to get tested to see whether they carried the BRCA1 gene, 23% said they would probably get tested, and 7% said they would definitely get tested. The others reported that they would not get tested. Kosenko said that separate studies demonstrated increased genetic testing requests and Internet searches related to BRCA1 after Jolie's announcement. \"We rely heavily on friends and family for health information, and we tend to see certain celebrities as friends. Unfortunately, we do not share the same resources as these famous 'friends,' which impacts our ability to follow celebrity health advice,\" she said. \"For example, at the time of Jolie's announcement, the genetic tests she underwent were prohibitively expensive for the average American.\" There are examples of celebrities having a potentially harmful influence on public health too, said Hoffman, director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. 'I do blame celebrities' \"The most prominent example of harm would be, in my mind, Jenny McCarthy,\" Hoffman said. The American actress has been a vocal autism activist, spreading concerns that autism might be associated with childhood vaccines. McCarthy was unavailable for comment, but her representative said she addressed her stance on vaccines in an op-ed published in the Chicago Sun-Times in 2014, headlined \"The gray area on vaccines.\" Her son, Evan, was diagnosed with autism . She believes that doctors should change some children's vaccine schedules, such as allowing for one shot per doctor's visit instead of multiple shots, she wrote in the op-ed. \"I am not 'anti-vaccine.' This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, 'pro-vaccine' and for years I have been wrongly branded as 'anti-vaccine,' \" McCarthy wrote. \"My beautiful son, Evan, inspired this mother to question the 'one size fits all' philosophy of the recommended vaccine schedule,\" she wrote. \"I embarked on this quest not only for myself and my family, but for countless parents who shared my desire for knowledge that could lead to options and alternate schedules, but never to eliminate the vaccines.\" \"She is actually recommending practices that are unhealthful and potentially dangerous,\" Hoffman said about McCarthy's stance on changing vaccine schedules. \"Recommending to people not to vaccinate their children means not only are the children being subjected to unnecessary harm, but many others around those children who might not be able to get vaccinated for legitimate reasons are put at an additional risk ask well,\" he said. \"It's not only unfair to the children who aren't being vaccinated, but also to the many people who can't be vaccinated, who interact with those children.\" Even though they are vulnerable to illness, some people may not be able to get certain vaccines based on age, an allergy or pre-existing health condition, or other factors, according to the CDC Public health experts also have accused actress Gwyneth Paltrow of spreading some questionable health tips through her lifestyle blog, goop. In a written statement, goop spokeswoman Noora Raj Brown described the website as pushing \"new ideas into the conversation\" in health and wellness. \"We have a disclaimer on the bottom of every article that states the purpose is to highlight alternative studies and induce conversation. It's not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The views of the experts profiled don't necessarily represent the views of goop,\" the statement said. One blog post on goop recommended inserting a rock, called a jade egg, into your vagina to improve your sex life and orgasms, among other benefits. Some experts have said that not thoroughly cleaning or sterilizing the jade egg could lead to infection , or that it could get stuck. \"In many cases, there are opposing opinions on issues -- like the jade eggs for example -- and our role is to service the conversation,\" Brown said. \"Gwyneth Paltrow's messages, it's mostly that she's recommending practices that don't work,\" Hoffman said. \"The biggest harm is the loss or waste of money and the misplaced attention away from practices that actually work.\" jade egg on goop costs about $66. Hoffman said that the money could be better spent on buying nutritious foods or a gym membership. \"Do celebrities have an impact on health outcomes? We know they do. ... There's so many studies out there that have demonstrated that when celebrities either give helpful or harmful advice to people, it's routinely followed,\" Hoffman said. \"I do blame celebrities, because they need to recognize the impact they can have and the potential harm that can result from it,\" he said. \"I definitely blame those who are spreading misinformation.\" How celebrities have hacked public health talks Hoffman and his colleagues published a review paper in the British Medical Journal to analyze the influence celebrities have on people's health decisions through the factors of economics, marketing, psychology and sociology. \"In marketing literature, they talk about a halo effect around celebrities, whereby people have a very positive view of celebrities, and when celebrities endorse a product or recommend a particular health practice, it transfers their golden glow from the celebrity to the products or practice,\" Hoffman said. \"In economics literature, there's recognition of something called signaling, which is whereby in a marketplace filled with competing ideas, people are constantly looking for a shortcut in order to identify which products or practices they should be following, and so a celebrity endorsing a product provides a cognitive shortcut to an otherwise very complicated decision,\" he said. \"There is increasing recognition of the role of social networks, and there's few people who have bigger social networks than celebrities. Just think of the number of Twitter followers some celebrities have cultivated.\" However, Ayers, author of the latest study, said it might not be that complicated. \"It's not so much about a celebrity effect,\" he said, adding that when celebrities speak out about health-related issues, it may resonate because they are speaking as humans with just as much vulnerability to health impacts as anyone else. \"Typically, public health uses top-down strategies. The most effective messages are believed to come from the experts, 'from the top.' The people who know the most about the subject, the people who are paid to sit around and think about the subject,\" Ayers said. \"It turns out, though, that if you look at the Sheen effect and if you look at these other examples of organic media events ... that's not the case. These messages, they come from the bottom; they come from ordinary people. People who aren't health experts. Sheen might be a celebrity, but he's not a health expert. Angelina Jolie is not a health expert,\" he said. All in all, Hoffman said, public health officials could work with celebrities to harness their fame to spread evidence-based health information and mitigate the spread of misinformation. He cited supermodel Christy Turlington Burns as a positive example of a celebrity working with public health authorities to promote positive health practices. She served as a spokeswoman in CDC promotional ads raising awareness about smoking cessation and the health risks of smoking. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. Ayers said he saw public health officials utilize the power of Sheen's celebrity in real time, not during but after his HIV announcement. \"It turns out that actually because of our study, we got to see those things happen. When we published our study, a few weeks later, Charlie Sheen began speaking out about HIV prevention, particularly condoms, and he cited our study as one of the reasons for doing that,\" Ayers said of the study on Google searches. \"We also saw several leading organizations in HIV prevention begin to use Charlie Sheen's disclosure as a way to promote HIV prevention.\" Hoffman said it would be beneficial to see more examples of celebrities and public health leaders working together in the future. \"I think there probably are a lot of celebrities who want to do good and would be open to the idea of working with public health officials to do good,\" he said. \"We just need to still figure out the best way of doing that, in terms of what would be most effective.\" For now, to make informed health decisions, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, offered some guidance in an email. \"Get a second opinion,\" he wrote. \"Trust but verify celebrity statements from trusted health sources like the American Cancer Society, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, APHA, American Academy of Pediatrics\" and others.", "summary": "(CNN) When celebrities speak, it seems, the world listens -- even when it comes to personal and public health.

As I noted at the time, such a search spike suggested, but didn&rsquo;t prove on its own, that Sheen&rsquo;s high-profile interview may have saved some lives by leading some people to change their behavior: &ldquo;The big question, of course, is what percentage of these searches will lead to action &mdash; to the querier getting tested or having safer sex.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what Ayers and his colleagues sought to find out for a new study <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11121-017-0792-2\">just published in <em>Prevention Science</em></a>.

The team monitored Google searches in the United States between January 2005 and June 2017, including all searches with the terms marijuana, weed, pot, or cannabis combined with the terms buy, shop, or order (for example., \"buy marijuana\"). They omitted similar but irrelevant searches like \"buy weed killer.\" The team then replicated the relevant searches and checked to see whether the resulting websites advertised mail-order marijuana.

Malone Associate Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. The team found marijuana shopping searches nearly tripled in the United States from 2005 to 2017, peaking between 1.4 and 2.4 million searches each month. Marijuana shopping searches were highest in Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Nevada. However, the annual growth rate in searching for these terms increased in all but two states, Alabama and Mississippi, suggesting demand is accelerating across the nation.

Forty-one percent of all search results linked to retailers advertising mail-order marijuana, promising delivery using a variety of methods including the United State Postal Service, commercial parcel companies such as UPS, or private courier. Moreover, mail-order marijuana retailers occupied half of the first-page results, and three out of every four searches resulted in a mail-order marijuana retailer as the very first suggested link.

Its a new method of consuming tobacco that claims to reduce or eliminate many of the harmful compounds that are produced with e-cigarettes, as well as combustible products like cigarettes, and its gaining popularity and \"poised for explosive growth,\" researchers say. READ MORE: Young Canadians know theyre being targeted by e-cigarette marketing: study Heat-not-burn tobacco is one of the newest tobacco products out there. Users heat leaf tobacco to about 500 degrees Fahrenheit using battery power. This then turns the tobacco into an inhalable aerosol. Japan is currently the only country where heat-not-burn tobacco products are sold widely, so researchers compared Google search from that country to e-cigarette Google searches in the U.S. Story continues below advertisement 6:35 Is the new heat not burn tobacco product the answer to reduce smoking in Canada? Is the new heat not burn tobacco product the answer to reduce smoking in Canada? - Sep 17, 2017 According to the study, heat-not-burn queries in Japan spiked by 1,426 per cent the first year it was on the market in 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, the number of queries grew by 2,956 per cent. Based on the observed trends, researchers now project that heat-not-burn queries will continue to grow at a similar rate through 2018. \"Heat-not-burn products have quickly become insanely popular,\" study co-author Mark Dredze said in a statement. \"Two years ago, there were essentially no queries in Japan for heat-not-burn tobacco, but now there are between 5.9 and 7.5 million each month.\" Researchers also found that the interest in heat-not-burn products is surpassing the interest in e-cigarettes in Japan, which could mean sales of the new product will surpass e-cigarettes. But what about in Canada? Heat-not-burn products exist in Canada now, but the popularity is just beginning to grow, says Dr. Matthew Stanbrook, a specialist in respirology at Toronto Western Hospital. Story continues below advertisement \"Its in the midst of gaining popularity but its still fairly low-key,\" he says. \"I think its popularity is dwarfed by e-cigarettes at the moment, which has become the trendier thing to switch to if youre going to use an alternative nicotine delivery system, but it is growing and its got big, well-financed tobacco companies behind it.\" LISTEN: Learning more about heat-not-burn tobacco on Calgary Today According to Philip Morris International , these products \"[offer] the possibility of significantly reducing both the number and the levels of [harmful and potentially harmful constituents] HPHCs generated by tobacco products, whilst retaining an acceptable sensory experience for current adult smokers,\" their website reads.

Back to Healio Sexual minority adolescents were significantly more likely to report that they considered, planned or attempted suicide compared with heterosexual teenagers in the United States, according to 2015 national survey data published in JAMA. \"Sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning) adolescents are believed to have elevated suicide risks. Studies supporting this claim, however, rarely use nationally representative samples, which is a major limitation given that stigma and prevention resources vary across communities and may influence suicide risk behaviors,\" John W. Ayers, PhD, adjunct associate professor at San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health, and colleagues wrote. \"When nationally representative studies are available, they are not recent. Moreover, studies have ignored the diversity among sexual minorities, assuming all share the same risks.\" To determine suicide risk behaviors among sexual minority adolescents in high school, researchers used nationally representative data from the 2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Participants responded privately to questionnaires via computer that asked whether they had seriously considered, planned or attempted suicide in the past year. The investigators used the answers to compare these suicide risk behaviors between sexual minority teenagers and heterosexuals. Overall, 15,624 participants reported their sexual orientation as heterosexual, gay or lesbian, bisexual or questioning. In the past year, 40% of sexual minority adolescents reported seriously considering suicide (95% CI, 36.4-42.9); 34.9% reported planning suicide, (95% CI, 31.1- 38.6); and 24.9% reported attempting suicide (95% CI, 21.5- 28.2) compared with 14.8% (95% CI, 13.7-15.9) of heterosexuals considering; 11.9% (95% CI, 10.7-13) planning; and 6.3% (95% CI, 5.5-7.2) attempting suicide. Compared with heterosexuals, sexual minority teenagers were significantly more likely to consider (RR = 2.45; 95% CI, 2.12-2.81), plan (RR = 2.59; 95% CI, 2.18-3.04) and attempt (RR = 3.37; 95% CI, 2.73-4.09) suicide, after adjusting for confounders. Analysis of sexual minority subgroups showed that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning teens were all at elevated risk for suicide relative to heterosexuals. Bisexual adolescents were 46% more likely to consider, 40.8% more likely to plan or 31.9% more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual adolescents.

The study follows on 2016 research that found the the Internet was abuzz with millions more searches for HIV-related topics after the former \"Two and a Half Men\" star made the disclosure in November of 2015. In total, all English-language searches about HIV quadrupled beyond the usual number the day after Sheen's announcement, said a team from San Diego State University. Searches for information about HIV symptoms and testing were about six times higher than normal. And their follow-up research has now found that weekly sales of the HIV home-test kit OraQuick nearly doubled in the week after the announcement. \"Charlie Sheen's disclosure is potentially the most significant domestic HIV prevention event in the last decade,\" said study author John Ayers, a research professor with the university's Graduate School of Public Health. To put the event into perspective, the researchers say that OraQuick sales in the period around Sheen's announcement were eight times higher than sales around World AIDS Day, Dec. 1. That day is set aside each year to help promote HIV testing and prevention. Why does a celebrity announcement have such a profound effect on people's health care? According to study coauthor Jon-Patrick Allem, it's because people tend to identify with individuals, not statistics. \"It is easy to imagine that a single individual, like Sheen, disclosing his HIV status may be more compelling and motivating for people than an unnamed mass of individuals or a lecture from public health leaders,\" Allem said in a university news release. He's a research scientist with the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. Ayers and his colleagues began their research into the effect of Sheen's disclosure on the morning he announced on television that he'd been diagnosed with the AIDS virus. \"We understood there would be some impact from Sheen's disclosure,\" Ayers explained at the time of the 2016 study's release, \"but the exact nature of that impact was unknown.\" The researchers analyzed news stories and Google searches in the years before Sheen's announcement and in the weeks afterward. According to the study, English-language news stories available on the Internet about HIV fell from 67 per 1,000 in 2004 to 12 per 1,000 in 2015. But the number of stories grew by 265 percent on the day of Sheen's disclosure, to around 25 per 1,000, the researchers found. On the day of his disclosure, about 2.8 million more Google searches than usual included the term \"HIV,\" and 1.3 million searches included search terms seeking information about condoms, HIV symptoms and HIV testing. (The researchers came up with these numbers after adjusting statistics so they wouldn't be thrown off by factors such as especially high or low numbers of searches.) \"More searches for HIV occurred on the day of Sheen's disclosure than have ever occurred on any other day\" since Google began tracking the number of searches in 2005, said study co-author Eric Leas, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego. \"This finding is extremely exciting for the public health community. The magnitude of Sheen's disclosure reminds us of the incredible impact that Magic Johnson had on public discourse around HIV in the early 1990s. Sheen's disclosure could potentially have a more pronounced effect,\" Leas added. Why do all these searches matter? Ayers said they reveal \"what the public is thinking and when they're thinking it. We can see that the public is actively engaged in trying to improve their health or health awareness by searching.\" Dr. Mitchell Katz, director of the Los Angeles County Health Agency, wrote a commentary accompanying the study. In an interview, he said announcements like this \"rock the public's sense of denial and make them wonder if they, too, could be infected or could become infected. That is why announcements like this result in people not only googling Charlie Sheen but googling information about HIV prevention and testing.\" The 2016 study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine, while the latest study with data on OraQuick sales, was published May 18 in Prevention Science.

To put the event into perspective, the researchers say that OraQuick sales in the period around Sheen's announcement were eight times higher than sales around World AIDS Day, Dec. 1. That day is set aside each year to help promote HIV testing and prevention. Why does a celebrity announcement have such a profound effect on people's health care? According to study coauthor Jon-Patrick Allem, it's because people tend to identify with individuals, not statistics. \"It is easy to imagine that a single individual, like Sheen, disclosing his HIV status may be more compelling and motivating for people than an unnamed mass of individuals or a lecture from public health leaders,\" Allem said in a university news release. He's a research scientist with the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. Ayers and his colleagues began their research into the effect of Sheen's disclosure on the morning he announced on television that he'd been diagnosed with the AIDS virus. \"We understood there would be some impact from Sheen's disclosure,\" Ayers explained at the time of the 2016 study's release, \"but the exact nature of that impact was unknown.\" The researchers analyzed news stories and Google searches in the years before Sheen's announcement and in the weeks afterward. According to the study, English-language news stories available on the Internet about HIV fell from 67 per 1,000 in 2004 to 12 per 1,000 in 2015. But the number of stories grew by 265 percent on the day of Sheen's disclosure, to around 25 per 1,000, the researchers found. On the day of his disclosure, about 2.8 million more Google searches than usual included the term \"HIV,\" and 1.3 million searches included search terms seeking information about condoms, HIV symptoms and HIV testing. (The researchers came up with these numbers after adjusting statistics so they wouldn't be thrown off by factors such as especially high or low numbers of searches.) \"More searches for HIV occurred on the day of Sheen's disclosure than have ever occurred on any other day\" since Google began tracking the number of searches in 2005, said study co-author Eric Leas, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego. \"This finding is extremely exciting for the public health community. The magnitude of Sheen's disclosure reminds us of the incredible impact that Magic Johnson had on public discourse around HIV in the early 1990s. Sheen's disclosure could potentially have a more pronounced effect,\" Leas added. Why do all these searches matter? Ayers said they reveal \"what the public is thinking and when they're thinking it. We can see that the public is actively engaged in trying to improve their health or health awareness by searching.\" Dr. Mitchell Katz, director of the Los Angeles County Health Agency, wrote a commentary accompanying the study. In an interview, he said announcements like this \"rock the public's sense of denial and make them wonder if they, too, could be infected or could become infected. That is why announcements like this result in people not only googling Charlie Sheen but googling information about HIV prevention and testing.\" The 2016 study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine, while the latest study with data on OraQuick sales, was published May 18 in Prevention Science.

Little evidence of THC and CBD for mental illness The researchers analysis included 83 studies from 1980 through 2018 that looked at the use of cannabinoids to treat symptoms of mental health conditions. This included studies looking at the treatment of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), psychosis, and Tourette syndrome.

The study authors note that there are less than 30 studies in the medical literature on these devices. On account of this, they turned to nontraditional data, including Google search information to analyze growing interest in the product. \"[Google searches] are probably a stronger indicator of interest than if you just asked on a survey,\" John Ayers, a lead study author and a research professor at San Diego State, told Healthline. \"Here were observing people seeking out information on the product, potentially trying to buy the product.\" Ayers said looking at this kind of data before has previously been able to predict the rise of e-cigarettes, as well as other things such as movie and album sales. What theyve seen so far of heat-not-burn tobacco products gives every indication that they could be a phenomenon, dwarfing even e-cigarettes. According to the study, there are now about 6 to 7 million \"heat-not-burn\" Google searches in Japan each month. Two years ago, almost no one was searching for them online. \"That growth rate eclipses anything else weve ever seen for any other tobacco product, including electronic cigarettes,\" said Ayers. Researchers said that given these trends, the potential for massive growth both in the United States and around the globe is likely. Why the product is popular The appeal of the product is manifold. It offers a novel new form of nicotine consumption that could be of interest to e-cigarette smokers. It also offers a distinct \"throat-hit,\" a physical sensation of smoking cigarettes, thats sometimes lacking in other vaporizers or e-cigarette models. However, the health implications of heat-not-burn products are still not well understood. \"There are all these public health questions like 'Can it be a cessation device? We dont know,\" said Ayers. \"What are the harms of it? What are the harms of being exposed to the vapor? We dont know that.\" E-cigarettes, which have already been on the market for years, are still problematic. Researchers have yet to reach a conclusion on their overall effects on public health. While recent studies indicate that e-cigarettes are most likely a healthier option than traditional smoking, not all experts agree. The role of e-cigarettes as potential cessation devices is still debated. The allure of e-cigarettes for teens, especially on account of sweet, fruit, and candy flavored vaping liquids also remains particularly contentious.", "summary_dict": {"headline": "Heat-Not-Burn Tobacco Products", "author": ["Gigen Mammoser"], "date_publish": "2017-10-18 17:00:00", "date_modify": "None", "date_download": "2021-06-16 16:34:33", "language": "en", "image_url": "https://post.healthline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3163-girl_smoking-1296x728-header-1200x628.jpg", "filename": "https://www.healthline.com/health-news/will-consumers-warm-up-to-heat-not-burn-tobacco.json", "description": "Federal regulators are studying these products that heat tobacco rather than burn it.

On account of this, they turned to nontraditional data, including Google search information to analyze growing interest in the product. \"[Google searches] are probably a stronger indicator of interest than if you just asked on a survey,\" John Ayers, a lead study author and a research professor at San Diego State, told Healthline. \"Here were observing people seeking out information on the product, potentially trying to buy the product.\" Ayers said looking at this kind of data before has previously been able to predict the rise of e-cigarettes, as well as other things such as movie and album sales. What theyve seen so far of heat-not-burn tobacco products gives every indication that they could be a phenomenon, dwarfing even e-cigarettes. According to the study, there are now about 6 to 7 million \"heat-not-burn\" Google searches in Japan each month. Two years ago, almost no one was searching for them online. \"That growth rate eclipses anything else weve ever seen for any other tobacco product, including electronic cigarettes,\" said Ayers. Researchers said that given these trends, the potential for massive growth both in the United States and around the globe is likely. Why the product is popular The appeal of the product is manifold. It offers a novel new form of nicotine consumption that could be of interest to e-cigarette smokers. It also offers a distinct \"throat-hit,\" a physical sensation of smoking cigarettes, thats sometimes lacking in other vaporizers or e-cigarette models. However, the health implications of heat-not-burn products are still not well understood. \"There are all these public health questions like 'Can it be a cessation device? We dont know,\" said Ayers. \"What are the harms of it? What are the harms of being exposed to the vapor? We dont know that.\" E-cigarettes, which have already been on the market for years, are still problematic. Researchers have yet to reach a conclusion on their overall effects on public health. While recent studies indicate that e-cigarettes are most likely a healthier option than traditional smoking, not all experts agree. The role of e-cigarettes as potential cessation devices is still debated. The allure of e-cigarettes for teens, especially on account of sweet, fruit, and candy flavored vaping liquids also remains particularly contentious.", "summary": "New research from San Diego State University predicts that \"heat-not-burn\" tobacco products could soon be flooding American markets. Heat-not-burn tobacco products are the latest iteration of electronic smoking. However, the product must undergo rigorous review because its being brought to market as a \" modified risk tobacco product .\" Modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) is a designation given by the FDA that refers to \"tobacco products that are sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco products.\" To achieve this designation, an applicant must demonstrate that the product has the ability to \"significantly reduce harm\" and disease related to tobacco.

The search volume was highest in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Nevada. The overall annual growth-rate for marijuana shopping searches, researchers found, was significantly positive since 2005, in all studied states, bar Alabama and Mississippi. This, authors assert, suggests a growing demand across the nation. Furthermore, forty-one percent of all monitored search results linked to retailers selling marijuana.

Last Thursday, the White House called for legislation to protect patients from getting surprise doctor bills when they are rushed to the emergency room and receive care from doctors not covered by insurance at an in-network hospital. The financial burden on patients can be substantial -- these doctor charges can amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Whats behind this explosion of outrageous charges and surprise medical bills? Physicians groups, it turns out, can opt out of a contract with insurers even if the hospital has such a contract. The doctors are then free to charge patients, who desperately need care, however much they want.

As calls for radical health reform grow louder, many on the right, in the center and in the health care industry are arguing that proposals like \"Medicare for all\" would cause economic ruin, decimating a sector that represents nearly 20 percent of our economy.

Thirty-three states have legalized medical marijuana, 10 of which (where 1 in 4 individuals reside) have also legalized recreational marijuana. Sales of marijuana are projected to increase from $8.5 billion to $75 billion by 2030, rivaling current tobacco sales ($125 billion). The initial marijuana marketplace was limited to a few states, but emerging brands have developed sophisticated national marketing campaigns that could potentially have an effect across state lines. This marketplace expansion, along with questionable marketing practices, introduces a need for federal action. (John W. Ayers, Theodore Caputi and Eric C.

(Trans and gender-nonconforming youth were not incorporated into this study.) \"There have been some indications that LGBQ youth face increased suicide risks, yet many believed the jury was still out,\" wrote study author John Ayers of SDSUs School of Public Health. \"Our study yields a clear verdict: LGBQ youth face staggeringly high suicide risks.\" The study did not explore the causes of suicidal ideation among queer youth, but LGBT kids are more likely to be subjected to a host of negative influences, including bullying, rejection by family, conversion therapy and homelessness. Depression among LGBT people has been shown to increase significantly after new laws that discriminate against gay people are passed. Researchers out of the University of Nevada recently reported that gay, lesbian, bisexual and questioning youth who reported at least one adverse childhood experience ((ACE) were seven times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual students. More than half of LGB students reported at least two ACEs, which raises their odds of attempting suicide to 13 times that of their straight peers. \"It is imperative that we identify adolescent populations at greatest risk to guide our prevention efforts,\" author Kristen Clements-Nolle told Reuters.

Now experts predict that heat-not-burn devices are set soar in popularity. A study suggests they will overtake sales of e-cigarettes, which are used by an estimated 9 million adults in the US and around 2.9 million in the UK. This has caused campaigners to warn there is an 'urgent need' for more research into the health effects of devices which heat tobacco as opposed to burning it. The team from the US analysed Google search trends relating to the heat-not-burn devices in Japan, which was the first country to sell them. Their findings showed a huge surge in demand for the items - rising by 2,956 per cent in the two years from 2015 to 2017. It's now expected that the same could happen in other countries, after the first heat-not-burn device became available in the UK in November last year and products entered the FDA-approval process in the US in May. Experts say they expect a huge surge in demand for heat-not-burn devices (stock image) WHAT ARE HEAT-NOT-BURN E-CIGARETTES? Heat-not-burn e-cigarettes were originally created by tobacco giant Philip Morris International. They were behind a smokeless device known as IQOS, that is said to contain 90 per cent less toxins that ordinary ones. Different from e-cigarettes, the electronic device is used with mini tobacco sticks, in the form of Marlboro HeatSticks or others, as opposed to a nicotine-laced liquid. These are then placed into the device before being heated, which experts say makes them much less harmful because they aren't burning the tobacco. But experts argue that the innovative device will never be safer than e-cigarettes and doesn't appear to be a safe option. Advertisement Study coauthor Mark Dredze, professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, said: 'Heat-not-burn products have quickly become insanely popular. 'Two years ago, there were essentially no queries in Japan for heat-not-burn tobacco, but now there are between 5.9 and 7.5 million each month.' Furthermore, the team found that interest in heat-not-burn tobacco in Japan is rising more rapidly than past interest in e-cigarettes when they were first introduced to market. The study authors added: 'This suggests that as heat-not-burn tobacco is introduced in new markets, its popularity may even eclipse e-cigarettes.' Throat-hit appeal The new products gently heat tobacco to a balmy 260degC to produce a tobacco vapour. Co-author Dr John Ayers, an associate research professor at the San Diego State University, said heat-not-burn devices appeal to smokers who still demand the 'throat-hit' delivered by a regular cigarette. This hit isn't obtained by most e-cigs, because they vapourise nicotine - the addictive part of a cigarette - but they don't contain any tobacco. Independent research is needed Tobacco kills up to half of its users - that's more than seven million people each year, according to the World Health Organization. And while the jury is still largely out on the long-term effects of vaping, heat-not-burn devices are currently only on sale in a handful of places around the world and little is known about their credentials. As with many e-cigs, the devices are produced and sold by the big tobacco companies, eager not to lose business as more and more people quit smoking. Now public health officials who were 'caught off guard' by e-cigarettes, are being urged to get clued up now and set the agenda before the tobacco giants get their first. 'Tobacco companies try to outmaneuver public health protections by creating new products that make tobacco appear less dangerous and more appealing,' said Theodore Caputi, a Mitchell Scholar and the study's first author. 'People were caught off guard by e-cigarettes, for example. Our study is an early warning and a call to action for public health professionals to address heat-not-burn products now.' Campaign group ASH said because of the tobacco industry's 'long record of deceit over the health risks of smoking', there is an 'urgent need' for independent research into these new devices. Smoke released by these heat-not-burn e-cigarette devices contain 84 per cent of the nicotine found in traditional cigarettes, a previous study shows (pictured: the IQOS cigarette by Philip Morris International) HOW MUCH SAFER ARE 'SMOKELESS' CIGARETTES? They've been touted as the safest way of smoking in recent years. But research in May suggests 'smokeless' cigarettes may contain more cancer-causing chemicals than believed. Smoking giant Philip Morris markets its IQOS device, which tobacco sticks can be placed into to be heated, as containing 90 per cent less toxins.

'Fully independent research and assessment will be crucial if heat-not-burn tobacco products are to be accepted as useful in fighting the smoking epidemic.' Dr Ayers said that tobacco control is 'at a new crossroads'.

Now experts predict that heat-not-burn devices are set soar in popularity. A study suggests they will overtake sales of e-cigarettes, which are used by an estimated 9 million adults in the US and around 2.9 million in the UK. This has caused campaigners to warn there is an 'urgent need' for more research into the health effects of devices which heat tobacco as opposed to burning it. The team from the US analysed Google search trends relating to the heat-not-burn devices in Japan, which was the first country to sell them. Their findings showed a huge surge in demand for the items - rising by 2,956 per cent in the two years from 2015 to 2017. It's now expected that the same could happen in other countries, after the first heat-not-burn device became available in the UK in November last year and products entered the FDA-approval process in the US in May. Experts say they expect a huge surge in demand for heat-not-burn devices (stock image) WHAT ARE HEAT-NOT-BURN E-CIGARETTES? Heat-not-burn e-cigarettes were originally created by tobacco giant Philip Morris International. They were behind a smokeless device known as IQOS, that is said to contain 90 per cent less toxins that ordinary ones. Different from e-cigarettes, the electronic device is used with mini tobacco sticks, in the form of Marlboro HeatSticks or others, as opposed to a nicotine-laced liquid. These are then placed into the device before being heated, which experts say makes them much less harmful because they aren't burning the tobacco. But experts argue that the innovative device will never be safer than e-cigarettes and doesn't appear to be a safe option. Advertisement Study coauthor Mark Dredze, professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, said: 'Heat-not-burn products have quickly become insanely popular. 'Two years ago, there were essentially no queries in Japan for heat-not-burn tobacco, but now there are between 5.9 and 7.5 million each month.' Furthermore, the team found that interest in heat-not-burn tobacco in Japan is rising more rapidly than past interest in e-cigarettes when they were first introduced to market. The study authors added: 'This suggests that as heat-not-burn tobacco is introduced in new markets, its popularity may even eclipse e-cigarettes.' Throat-hit appeal The new products gently heat tobacco to a balmy 260degC to produce a tobacco vapour. Co-author Dr John Ayers, an associate research professor at the San Diego State University, said heat-not-burn devices appeal to smokers who still demand the 'throat-hit' delivered by a regular cigarette. This hit isn't obtained by most e-cigs, because they vapourise nicotine - the addictive part of a cigarette - but they don't contain any tobacco. Independent research is needed Tobacco kills up to half of its users - that's more than seven million people each year, according to the World Health Organization. And while the jury is still largely out on the long-term effects of vaping, heat-not-burn devices are currently only on sale in a handful of places around the world and little is known about their credentials. As with many e-cigs, the devices are produced and sold by the big tobacco companies, eager not to lose business as more and more people quit smoking. Now public health officials who were 'caught off guard' by e-cigarettes, are being urged to get clued up now and set the agenda before the tobacco giants get their first. 'Tobacco companies try to outmaneuver public health protections by creating new products that make tobacco appear less dangerous and more appealing,' said Theodore Caputi, a Mitchell Scholar and the study's first author. 'People were caught off guard by e-cigarettes, for example. Our study is an early warning and a call to action for public health professionals to address heat-not-burn products now.' Campaign group ASH said because of the tobacco industry's 'long record of deceit over the health risks of smoking', there is an 'urgent need' for independent research into these new devices. Smoke released by these heat-not-burn e-cigarette devices contain 84 per cent of the nicotine found in traditional cigarettes, a previous study shows (pictured: the IQOS cigarette by Philip Morris International) HOW MUCH SAFER ARE 'SMOKELESS' CIGARETTES? They've been touted as the safest way of smoking in recent years. But research in May suggests 'smokeless' cigarettes may contain more cancer-causing chemicals than believed. Smoking giant Philip Morris markets its IQOS device, which tobacco sticks can be placed into to be heated, as containing 90 per cent less toxins. However, a study found it contains some chemicals that are strongly linked to cancer in much higher concentrations than previously reported. These included carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, scientists said.
