Heat-not-burn cigarettes are battery-powered devices that take tobacco to the brink of combustion by heating tobacco leaves to around 500 degrees and producing an inhalable aerosol, researcher Theodore L. Caputi and colleagues wrote in a recent PLOS One-published study. The smoking alternative has exploded in Japan, where average monthly searches for heat-not-burn tobacco products rose 1,426 percent between 2015 and 2016, but clinicians are largely unaware of its cardiovascular risks. \"We do not know the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco,\" Caputi said in an email. \"While they are likely to be marketed--formally or informally--as 'healthier than cigarettes, there is insufficient evidence to make that claim. In itself, insufficient evidence is dangerous--tobacco companies have proven they wont wait until all the facts are in before they begin making health claims, and public health researchers need to fill in knowledge gaps quickly so that consumers can make well-informed decisions.\" Because of the public health implications of tobacco use, Caputi said, including the fact that nearly half of all smokers are estimated to die from a smoking-related illness, \"this is not a decision that consumers should take lightly.\" In his study, Caputi and four colleagues used Google search query data to analyze the rising popularity of heat-not-burn products. Because traditional surveys about smoking dont ask about heat-not-burn tobacco, and since the product has little visibility in U.S. markets, the researchers focused on search engine analysis to evaluate the scale and growth potential of the new trend. In Japan, they found, there are now between 5.9 and 7.5 million estimated heat-not-burn-related Google searches per month, based on estimates from September. After initial heat-not-burn products hit the Japanese market in 2015, spurring a nearly 1,500 percent peak in Google searches on the topic, related searches grew by an additional 100 percent during the next year. Caputi and colleagues compared search queries for heat-not-burn products in Japan to Google searches for e-cigarettes in the U.S., since e-cigarettes arent legal in Japan. Heat-not-burn searches occurred more frequently in Japan than e-cigarette searches did in the U.S., the authors reported, with the first queries for heat-not-burn cigarettes eclipsing e-cigarettes in April 2016. The popularity of e-cigarettes in the U.S. is waning, Caputi said in a September 2016 article published in the medical journal Tobacco Control. Whereas growth of the e-cig industry was predicted to rise 126 percent in 2016, new Euromonitor International statistics estimate the reality to be closer to 51 percent. E-cigarette users are becoming displeased with the taste of the product, he said, citing Wells Fargo tobacco analyst Bonnie Herzog. While consumers arent necessarily concerned with the health risks of the product, they notice a lag in gratification from e-cigarettes that isnt true for traditional cigarettes, which deliver nicotine to the bloodstream much more quickly. E-cigarettes also lack a \"throat hit,\" Caputi wrote, which many conventional tobacco users enjoy. Heat-not-burn products offer those feelings that e-cigarettes lack. \"The pervasiveness of e-cigarettes and spreading discontentment with the lack of a throat-hit may open the floodgate for heat-not-burns success,\" he wrote. Heat-not-burn cigarettes have been gradually introduced to an international market in more than 20 nations, including the United Kingdom, Russia, Korea, Switzerland and Italy, but the focal test market is Japan, Caputi and colleagues wrote in the PLOS One study. Japan Tobacco introduced its local heat-not-burn device, called Ploom TECH, in March 2016, and Philip Morris Internationals \"IQOS\" (\"I Quit Ordinary Smoking\") and British American Tobaccos \"Glo\" followed soon after. Now, PMI has entered the FDA approval process to start marketing and sales in the U.S. According to the Tobacco Control article, a Wells Fargo analyst predicted heat-not-burn products could displace up to 30 percent of the countrys combustible cigarette industry by 2025. Caputi wrote recent research has suggested heat-not-burn products are less harmful than combustible cigarettes, but other studies have shown risks of smoking heat-not-burn tobacco include carbon monoxide and formaldehyde exposure, as well as the potential for side-stream emissions. Reto Auer, MD, MAS, and colleagues found that PMIs IQOS releases smoke containing elements from pyrolysis and thermogenic degradation that mirror the components of traditional cigarette smoke. \"PMI claims that IQOS releases no smoke because the tobacco does not combust and the tobacco leaves are only heated, not burned,\" Auer and co-authors wrote in a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. \"However, there can be smoke without fire. Dancing around the definition of smoke to avoid indoor smoking bans is unethical.\" Now, Caputi said, is the time to act. In his PLOS One paper, he and co-authors wrote their findings were a \"clarion call\" for public health practitioners, who should expand heat-not-burn product surveillance, preemptively study the smoking alternatives risks and benefits and adjust health messaging about tobacco products. He said that despite the presence of the product overseas, clinicians in the U.S. are largely unaware of the trend and its implications. \"Unfortunately, we have insufficient evidence to make claims regarding the long-term health effects of either e-cigarettes or heat-not-burn devices, and so making comparisons at this point is very difficult,\" Caputi told Cardiovascular Business. \"However, we know that e-cigarettes are perceived as less harmful than traditional cigarettes, and we imagine heat-not-burn products will be marketed to cultivate that same perception. While its too early to tell if heat-not-burn products will overtake e-cigarettes as the new method of smoking, the available evidence suggests heat-not-burn products are poised for explosive growth as they are introduced into new markets.\"", "summary": "The smoking alternative has exploded in Japan, where average monthly searches for heat-not-burn tobacco products rose 1,426 percent between 2015 and 2016, but clinicians are largely unaware of its cardiovascular risks. \"We do not know the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco,\" Caputi said in an email.

Ayers, PhD, MA Vice Chief of Innovation | Assoc. Professor Div. Infectious Disease & Global Public Health University of California San Diego MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: The greatest barrier to understanding trends around sexual violence is they are largely hidden because victims are unable speak up publicly. Moreover, ongoing monitoring relies on proxies that underreport the scale of the problem such as police or medical records where only the most severe instances or a fraction of all instances of sexual violence are represented. As a result, we know very little about the scale of Americas sexual violence problem. It was this backdrop that inspired #MeToo to call on victims to publicly voice their stories thereby revealing the scale of the problem. Our goal was to, for the first time, assess how this change inspired the public to engage with sexual violence issues. By tracking private aggregate internet search query trends we can begin to understand the scale of public engagement with issues around sexual violence including the precise motivation for a search, such as reporting episodes of sexual violence or learning how to prevent sexual violence. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: Our study reveals that even months after the beginning of #MeToo millions more than otherwise expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. Sexual harassment and/or assault searches increased 86 percent following the #MeToo movement and have remained higher for 8 months. Not only did searches for sexual harassment and/or assault significantly increase -- searches specific to training and reporting also increased 51 percent and 30 percent, respectively, indicating that people were potentially changing their behavior in the post #MeToo era. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: Revealing this record setting and sustained engagement is a call to action for the nation. Survivors face serious health consequences including physical injury, PTSD symptoms, and emotional trauma. Yet, public investments in preventing and responding to sexual violence is disproportionately small compared with other health issues. With millions more than ever voicing their needs, our nations leaders should respond by investing in enhanced prevention training and improving resources for survivors. When victims seek out help online it is imperative they linked to evidenced based and effective resources. The same can be said for seeking out prevention resources. Investment in understanding these needs, developing responsive resources, and disseminating those resources are needed now. MedicalResearch.com: Is there anything else you would like to add? Response: MeToo is not the first movement to empower victims of sexual violence, but what is unique compared to past movements is #MeToos staying power. Eight months since the initiation of #MeToo millions more than expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. #MeToos sustainability, and our study alerting leaders to this, could yield major wins for the nations public health.

Gay teens were more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as heterosexual males, while bisexuals had more than five times the risk. The study wasnt a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how sexual orientation might influence suicide risk. Researchers also lacked data on gender identity or transgender youth, who may have an even higher risk of suicide than gay and bisexual teens. Even so, the results add to the evidence suggesting that sexual minority teens have a higher risk of suicide than other youth, said Hongying Dai, a researcher at Childrens Mercy Hospital and the University of Missouri-Kansas City who wasnt involved in the study. While the study didnt address what might have driven teens to consider or attempt suicide, its possible sexual minority teens might have been at increased risk because they experienced verbal harassment, physical bullying or felt unsafe at school, Dai said by email. \"Studies have linked high levels of stress due to social stigma, marginalization, discrimination and experiences of bullying with a wide range of risky health behaviors, including suicidal behaviors,\" Dai said. Parents may help reduce this stress by talking to their kids, said Kimberly McManama, a psychiatry researcher at Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School who wasnt involved in the study. \"Talk to your kids about their sexual and gender identity early and often,\" McManama said by email. \"Let them know that whatever they are feeling is ok with you and that you are ready and willing to talk about it with them when they are.\"", "summary": "Sexual minority youth were also more than twice as likely to contemplate suicide or plan a suicide attempt even if they didnt go through with it, the study also found. To assess suicide risk, participants were asked how many times in the past year they had seriously considered suicide, planned a suicide attempt or tried to kill themselves. By contrast, 15 percent of heterosexual adolescents said they had considered suicide and 12 percent said they had planned a suicide attempt. The increased suicide risk for sexual minority teens held true when researchers looked at females and males separately.

Unlike many other attempts at such therapies, the focus will be to ensure that the treatments are affordable and available to resource-poor countries, especially in Africa. The move comes amid growing concern that new treatments that alter the underlying genetics of a disease will be prohibitively expensive -- a gene therapy for a rare form of blindness, for instance, costs around $425,000 per eye. The initiative will aim to test any potential cures in the U.S. and countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the next seven to 10 years, and to then make such therapies available in the hardest-hit areas. \"We aim to go big or go home,\" NIH Director Francis Collins said in a statement. FDA wants stronger warning on breast implants about risks The FDA wants women getting breast implants to receive stronger warnings and more details about the risks and complications associated with the procedure. The agency issued a draft guidance document calling on breast implant makers to include a boxed warning as well as a checklist that patients can use to better understand the risks, including pain and scarring. The FDA is also recommending that labels include information about whats in the implants. The new guidance comes after reports in recent months linking certain kinds of implants with illnesses in women with the products. In July, the FDA asked Allergan to recall a type of its textured breast implants after several hundred women who received the implants developed a rare type of lymphoma. The guidance is now subject to a 60-day public comment period before being finalized. Inside STAT: A toxic weed fuels a cancer-drug gold rush -- and a quandary The drug was still experimental, but already it was something of a celebrity. For patients with Gorlin syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, the idea that a gel might reduce the skin cancer surgeries they needed was so seductive it hardly seemed real. In fact, it nearly hadnt been. The medicine had come from an unlikely place -- the wild cow cabbage patches around Manti-La Sal National Forest -- on an even unlikelier assumption: that this botanical Gold Rush would yield a treatment for a whole litany of cancers. In the second half of \"The Medicine Hunters,\" STATs Eric Boodman brings you inside both that drug-finding quest -- involving machetes, mowers, and some of the biggest pharma companies in the world -- as well as the quest of Gorlin patients to reduce these medications' financial toxicity. Read the story here. Google searches for CBD have skyrocketed in recent years CBD products are widely advertised as a treatment for a plethora of ailments, and a new study finds that Google searches for such items have also skyrocketed recently. Looking at data between January 2004 and April 2019, scientists found that although searches for CBD products were relatively stable during the first decade of the study period, they increased by 126% in 2017 compared to 2016, and 160% in 2018 compared to the previous year. There were more than 6 million searches last April, which outnumbered searches for other health terms including acupuncture and meditation. At the same time, a new report outlines the global use of different drugs -- including cannabis -- and finds that in Canada and some U.S. states, CBD products are used to treat medical conditions \"in the absence of evidence of their effectiveness and safety.\" A new test could identify tuberculosis in less than an hour Tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease globally, but quickly detecting it -- and distinguishing it from other respiratory infections with similar symptoms -- has remained a challenge. A new paper describes a test capable of diagnosing TB in less than an hour. Using machine learning techniques to sift through data from 317 patients, the scientists identified four blood proteins that are unique to tuberculosis to develop their test. The accuracy of the test improved when they added a fifth marker that picked up on specific proteins produced in response to toxins expressed by TB. Overall, the new test was correctly able to identify those with TB 86% of the time, and was correctly able to rule out disease in non-TB infected people 69% of the time, which aligns with the WHOs requirements for a new TB test. Nature journals gets a new look The scientific journal Nature and many of its affiliate journals -- where your Morning Rounds writer previously worked -- are getting a makeover. Specifically, many of the Nature journals now have a new \"digital friendly\" font and logo. This isnt the first time for such an update: In an article, Kelly Krause, one of Natures creative directors, explains that ornate Victorian embellishments graced the journal when it was founded in 1869, while it opted for a more minimalistic look in the 1960s. For the newest change, the team took into account how science often uses standalone letters to represent concepts -- such as a -- and how the new typeface needed to account for people accessing materials on smaller, mobile devices. The team ultimately settled on a typeface theyre calling Harding -- named for the late neurologist Anita Harding. What to read around the web today Is the stethoscope dying?

He's an associate research professor at San Diego State University's School of Public Health. In the study, Ayers' team examined Google searches about buying marijuana by Americans between January 2005 and June 2017. During that time, there was a threefold increase in such searches, peaking at between 1.4 million and 2.4 million searches a month. Marijuana shopping searches were highest in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state, where recreational marijuana use is legal. But such searches increased each year in all but two states -- Alabama and Mississippi. That suggests online shopping for the drug is increasing nationwide, the researchers said. Thirty states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that broadly expand the legal use of marijuana. The researchers also found that 41 percent of marijuana shopping search results linked to retailers advertising mail-order marijuana delivered through the U.S. Postal Service, commercial parcel companies or private couriers. Online sales of marijuana are illegal, even in states that have fully or partially legalized the drug, \"but clearly these regulations are failing,\" said study co-author Eric Leas, a research fellow at Stanford University. Immediate action is needed to halt online marijuana sales, according to study co-author Theodore Caputi, from the University College Cork in Ireland. \"Children could obtain marijuana online without safeguards to protect them,\" Caputi said in a San Diego State news release. And there are other concerns. \"States that have legalized marijuana might not be able to collect taxes to offset the public health costs of legal marijuana from online retailers, and the instant online availability of marijuana could increase marijuana dependence among all age groups,\" Caputi said. One possible approach is for public safety officials to work with internet service providers to eliminate marijuana retailers from major search engines, Ayers suggested. Doing so would \"effectively close off illicit retailers from consumers,\" he said. The study was published March 22 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Ayers, PhD, MA Vice Chief of Innovation | Assoc. Professor Div. Infectious Disease & Global Public Health University of California San Diego MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: The greatest barrier to understanding trends around sexual violence is they are largely hidden because victims are unable speak up publicly. Moreover, ongoing monitoring relies on proxies that underreport the scale of the problem such as police or medical records where only the most severe instances or a fraction of all instances of sexual violence are represented. As a result, we know very little about the scale of Americas sexual violence problem. It was this backdrop that inspired #MeToo to call on victims to publicly voice their stories thereby revealing the scale of the problem. Our goal was to, for the first time, assess how this change inspired the public to engage with sexual violence issues. By tracking private aggregate internet search query trends we can begin to understand the scale of public engagement with issues around sexual violence including the precise motivation for a search, such as reporting episodes of sexual violence or learning how to prevent sexual violence. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: Our study reveals that even months after the beginning of #MeToo millions more than otherwise expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. Sexual harassment and/or assault searches increased 86 percent following the #MeToo movement and have remained higher for 8 months. Not only did searches for sexual harassment and/or assault significantly increase -- searches specific to training and reporting also increased 51 percent and 30 percent, respectively, indicating that people were potentially changing their behavior in the post #MeToo era. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: Revealing this record setting and sustained engagement is a call to action for the nation. Survivors face serious health consequences including physical injury, PTSD symptoms, and emotional trauma. Yet, public investments in preventing and responding to sexual violence is disproportionately small compared with other health issues. With millions more than ever voicing their needs, our nations leaders should respond by investing in enhanced prevention training and improving resources for survivors. When victims seek out help online it is imperative they linked to evidenced based and effective resources. The same can be said for seeking out prevention resources. Investment in understanding these needs, developing responsive resources, and disseminating those resources are needed now. MedicalResearch.com: Is there anything else you would like to add? Response: MeToo is not the first movement to empower victims of sexual violence, but what is unique compared to past movements is #MeToos staying power. Eight months since the initiation of #MeToo millions more than expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. #MeToos sustainability, and our study alerting leaders to this, could yield major wins for the nations public health.

Heat-not-burn cigarettes are battery-powered devices that take tobacco to the brink of combustion by heating tobacco leaves to around 500 degrees and producing an inhalable aerosol, researcher Theodore L. Caputi and colleagues wrote in a recent PLOS One-published study. The smoking alternative has exploded in Japan, where average monthly searches for heat-not-burn tobacco products rose 1,426 percent between 2015 and 2016, but clinicians are largely unaware of its cardiovascular risks. \"We do not know the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco,\" Caputi said in an email. \"While they are likely to be marketed--formally or informally--as 'healthier than cigarettes, there is insufficient evidence to make that claim. In itself, insufficient evidence is dangerous--tobacco companies have proven they wont wait until all the facts are in before they begin making health claims, and public health researchers need to fill in knowledge gaps quickly so that consumers can make well-informed decisions.\" Because of the public health implications of tobacco use, Caputi said, including the fact that nearly half of all smokers are estimated to die from a smoking-related illness, \"this is not a decision that consumers should take lightly.\" In his study, Caputi and four colleagues used Google search query data to analyze the rising popularity of heat-not-burn products. Because traditional surveys about smoking dont ask about heat-not-burn tobacco, and since the product has little visibility in U.S. markets, the researchers focused on search engine analysis to evaluate the scale and growth potential of the new trend. In Japan, they found, there are now between 5.9 and 7.5 million estimated heat-not-burn-related Google searches per month, based on estimates from September. After initial heat-not-burn products hit the Japanese market in 2015, spurring a nearly 1,500 percent peak in Google searches on the topic, related searches grew by an additional 100 percent during the next year. Caputi and colleagues compared search queries for heat-not-burn products in Japan to Google searches for e-cigarettes in the U.S., since e-cigarettes arent legal in Japan. Heat-not-burn searches occurred more frequently in Japan than e-cigarette searches did in the U.S., the authors reported, with the first queries for heat-not-burn cigarettes eclipsing e-cigarettes in April 2016. The popularity of e-cigarettes in the U.S. is waning, Caputi said in a September 2016 article published in the medical journal Tobacco Control. Whereas growth of the e-cig industry was predicted to rise 126 percent in 2016, new Euromonitor International statistics estimate the reality to be closer to 51 percent. E-cigarette users are becoming displeased with the taste of the product, he said, citing Wells Fargo tobacco analyst Bonnie Herzog. While consumers arent necessarily concerned with the health risks of the product, they notice a lag in gratification from e-cigarettes that isnt true for traditional cigarettes, which deliver nicotine to the bloodstream much more quickly. E-cigarettes also lack a \"throat hit,\" Caputi wrote, which many conventional tobacco users enjoy. Heat-not-burn products offer those feelings that e-cigarettes lack. \"The pervasiveness of e-cigarettes and spreading discontentment with the lack of a throat-hit may open the floodgate for heat-not-burns success,\" he wrote. Heat-not-burn cigarettes have been gradually introduced to an international market in more than 20 nations, including the United Kingdom, Russia, Korea, Switzerland and Italy, but the focal test market is Japan, Caputi and colleagues wrote in the PLOS One study. Japan Tobacco introduced its local heat-not-burn device, called Ploom TECH, in March 2016, and Philip Morris Internationals \"IQOS\" (\"I Quit Ordinary Smoking\") and British American Tobaccos \"Glo\" followed soon after. Now, PMI has entered the FDA approval process to start marketing and sales in the U.S. According to the Tobacco Control article, a Wells Fargo analyst predicted heat-not-burn products could displace up to 30 percent of the countrys combustible cigarette industry by 2025. Caputi wrote recent research has suggested heat-not-burn products are less harmful than combustible cigarettes, but other studies have shown risks of smoking heat-not-burn tobacco include carbon monoxide and formaldehyde exposure, as well as the potential for side-stream emissions. Reto Auer, MD, MAS, and colleagues found that PMIs IQOS releases smoke containing elements from pyrolysis and thermogenic degradation that mirror the components of traditional cigarette smoke. \"PMI claims that IQOS releases no smoke because the tobacco does not combust and the tobacco leaves are only heated, not burned,\" Auer and co-authors wrote in a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. \"However, there can be smoke without fire. Dancing around the definition of smoke to avoid indoor smoking bans is unethical.\" Now, Caputi said, is the time to act. In his PLOS One paper, he and co-authors wrote their findings were a \"clarion call\" for public health practitioners, who should expand heat-not-burn product surveillance, preemptively study the smoking alternatives risks and benefits and adjust health messaging about tobacco products. He said that despite the presence of the product overseas, clinicians in the U.S. are largely unaware of the trend and its implications. \"Unfortunately, we have insufficient evidence to make claims regarding the long-term health effects of either e-cigarettes or heat-not-burn devices, and so making comparisons at this point is very difficult,\" Caputi told Cardiovascular Business. \"However, we know that e-cigarettes are perceived as less harmful than traditional cigarettes, and we imagine heat-not-burn products will be marketed to cultivate that same perception. While its too early to tell if heat-not-burn products will overtake e-cigarettes as the new method of smoking, the available evidence suggests heat-not-burn products are poised for explosive growth as they are introduced into new markets.\"", "summary": "The smoking alternative has exploded in Japan, where average monthly searches for heat-not-burn tobacco products rose 1,426 percent between 2015 and 2016, but clinicians are largely unaware of its cardiovascular risks. \"We do not know the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco,\" Caputi said in an email.

In a national survey of almost 16,000 youth, about 25 percent of LBGQ teens said they had attempted suicide at least once in the previous year, compared with roughly 6 percent of heterosexual teens, researchers report in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Sexual minority youth were also more than twice as likely to contemplate suicide or plan a suicide attempt even if they didnt go through with it, the study also found. \"LGBQ teens face staggeringly high suicide risks,\" said senior study author John Ayers, a researcher at San Diego State University. \"We must recognize LGBQ teen suicide is a national public health crisis and bring extraordinary resources to bear to address the crisis,\" Ayers said by email. While some previous research has pointed to the increased suicide risks for sexual minority teens, the current study offers fresh evidence from a large, nationally representative survey of U.S. high school students. Overall, 89 percent of the participants identified themselves as heterosexual in the 2015 survey. Another 2 percent identified as gay or lesbian, while 6 percent said they were bisexual and 3.2 percent said they were questioning or unsure about their sexual identity. To assess suicide risk, participants were asked how many times in the past year they had seriously considered suicide, planned a suicide attempt or tried to kill themselves. Among sexual minorities, 40 percent of the teens said they had considered suicide and 35 percent of them planned a suicide attempt, the study found. By contrast, 15 percent of heterosexual adolescents said they had considered suicide and 12 percent said they had planned a suicide attempt. The increased suicide risk for sexual minority teens held true when researchers looked at females and males separately. Lesbians were more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as heterosexual young women, and the odds were more than tripled for bisexuals. Gay teens were more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as heterosexual males, while bisexuals had more than five times the risk. The study wasnt a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how sexual orientation might influence suicide risk. Researchers also lacked data on gender identity or transgender youth, who may have an even higher risk of suicide than gay and bisexual teens. Even so, the results add to the evidence suggesting that sexual minority teens have a higher risk of suicide than other youth, said Hongying Dai, a researcher at Childrens Mercy Hospital and the University of Missouri-Kansas City who wasnt involved in the study. While the study didnt address what might have driven teens to consider or attempt suicide, its possible sexual minority teens might have been at increased risk because they experienced verbal harassment, physical bullying or felt unsafe at school, Dai said by email. \"Studies have linked high levels of stress due to social stigma, marginalization, discrimination and experiences of bullying with a wide range of risky health behaviors, including suicidal behaviors,\" Dai said. Parents may help reduce this stress by talking to their kids, said Kimberly McManama, a psychiatry researcher at Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School who wasnt involved in the study. \"Talk to your kids about their sexual and gender identity early and often,\" McManama said by email. \"Let them know that whatever they are feeling is ok with you and that you are ready and willing to talk about it with them when they are.\"", "summary": "Sexual minority youth were also more than twice as likely to contemplate suicide or plan a suicide attempt even if they didnt go through with it, the study also found.

For patients with Gorlin syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, the idea that a gel might reduce the skin cancer surgeries they needed was so seductive it hardly seemed real. In fact, it nearly hadnt been. The medicine had come from an unlikely place -- the wild cow cabbage patches around Manti-La Sal National Forest -- on an even unlikelier assumption: that this botanical Gold Rush would yield a treatment for a whole litany of cancers. In the second half of \"The Medicine Hunters,\" STATs Eric Boodman brings you inside both that drug-finding quest -- involving machetes, mowers, and some of the biggest pharma companies in the world -- as well as the quest of Gorlin patients to reduce these medications' financial toxicity. Read the story here. Google searches for CBD have skyrocketed in recent years CBD products are widely advertised as a treatment for a plethora of ailments, and a new study finds that Google searches for such items have also skyrocketed recently. Looking at data between January 2004 and April 2019, scientists found that although searches for CBD products were relatively stable during the first decade of the study period, they increased by 126% in 2017 compared to 2016, and 160% in 2018 compared to the previous year. There were more than 6 million searches last April, which outnumbered searches for other health terms including acupuncture and meditation. At the same time, a new report outlines the global use of different drugs -- including cannabis -- and finds that in Canada and some U.S. states, CBD products are used to treat medical conditions \"in the absence of evidence of their effectiveness and safety.\" A new test could identify tuberculosis in less than an hour Tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease globally, but quickly detecting it -- and distinguishing it from other respiratory infections with similar symptoms -- has remained a challenge. A new paper describes a test capable of diagnosing TB in less than an hour. Using machine learning techniques to sift through data from 317 patients, the scientists identified four blood proteins that are unique to tuberculosis to develop their test. The accuracy of the test improved when they added a fifth marker that picked up on specific proteins produced in response to toxins expressed by TB. Overall, the new test was correctly able to identify those with TB 86% of the time, and was correctly able to rule out disease in non-TB infected people 69% of the time, which aligns with the WHOs requirements for a new TB test. Nature journals gets a new look The scientific journal Nature and many of its affiliate journals -- where your Morning Rounds writer previously worked -- are getting a makeover. Specifically, many of the Nature journals now have a new \"digital friendly\" font and logo. This isnt the first time for such an update: In an article, Kelly Krause, one of Natures creative directors, explains that ornate Victorian embellishments graced the journal when it was founded in 1869, while it opted for a more minimalistic look in the 1960s. For the newest change, the team took into account how science often uses standalone letters to represent concepts -- such as a -- and how the new typeface needed to account for people accessing materials on smaller, mobile devices. The team ultimately settled on a typeface theyre calling Harding -- named for the late neurologist Anita Harding. What to read around the web today Is the stethoscope dying?

He's an associate research professor at San Diego State University's School of Public Health. In the study, Ayers' team examined Google searches about buying marijuana by Americans between January 2005 and June 2017. During that time, there was a threefold increase in such searches, peaking at between 1.4 million and 2.4 million searches a month. Marijuana shopping searches were highest in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state, where recreational marijuana use is legal. But such searches increased each year in all but two states -- Alabama and Mississippi. That suggests online shopping for the drug is increasing nationwide, the researchers said. Thirty states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that broadly expand the legal use of marijuana. The researchers also found that 41 percent of marijuana shopping search results linked to retailers advertising mail-order marijuana delivered through the U.S. Postal Service, commercial parcel companies or private couriers. Online sales of marijuana are illegal, even in states that have fully or partially legalized the drug, \"but clearly these regulations are failing,\" said study co-author Eric Leas, a research fellow at Stanford University. Immediate action is needed to halt online marijuana sales, according to study co-author Theodore Caputi, from the University College Cork in Ireland. \"Children could obtain marijuana online without safeguards to protect them,\" Caputi said in a San Diego State news release. And there are other concerns. \"States that have legalized marijuana might not be able to collect taxes to offset the public health costs of legal marijuana from online retailers, and the instant online availability of marijuana could increase marijuana dependence among all age groups,\" Caputi said. One possible approach is for public safety officials to work with internet service providers to eliminate marijuana retailers from major search engines, Ayers suggested. Doing so would \"effectively close off illicit retailers from consumers,\" he said. The study was published March 22 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Smartphone virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri and Bixby are handy when you want to consult tomorrow's weather forecast, find the nearest open pharmacy or access a list of movie times. But can they help you stop smoking and drinking? This is the question that a group of medical professors at the University of California, San Diego, decided to explore. \"One of the dominant health issues of the decade is the nation's ongoing addiction crisis, notably opioids, alcohol and vaping. As a result, it is an ideal case study to begin exploring the ability of intelligent virtual assistants to provide actionable answers for obvious health questions,\" explains Dr. John Ayers, the co-author of the study. The team of doctors conducted a test in which they successively questioned Alexa (Amazon), Siri (Apple), Google Assistant, Cortana (Microsoft) and Bixby (Samsung), asking among other things for help to stop drinking and smoking. In response to 70 help-seeking queries, the intelligent virtual assistants returned only four useful replies. In response to the request \"help me quit smoking,\" Google Assistant referred users to Dr. QuitNow, an American smoking cessation app. The rest of the time, the virtual assistants did not seem to understand the questions they were asked. Directing users to 1-800 helplines So there is still plenty of work to be done before smartphones can replace doctors. However, the authors of the research study published in NPJ Digital Medicine believe that changes to smartphone settings could enable them to provide better quality medical assistance for addictions. \"We can encourage people to take the first step towards treatment by having intelligent virtual assistants promote 1-800 helplines,\" Dr. Alicia Nobles, the main author of the study suggests for example. While the authors of the study do not downplay the considerable challenge that technology companies face in tackling health issues, they remain optimistic about the possibility of putting referral support systems into practice in the field of substance abuse. \"Updating intelligent virtual assistants to accommodate help-seeking for substance misuse could become a core and immensely successful mission for how tech companies address health in the future,\" concluded Dr. Nobles.", "summary": "A team of American doctors has highlighted the key role that virtual assistants could play in helping to prevent addiction.

The study follows on 2016 research that found the the Internet was abuzz with millions more searches for HIV-related topics after the former \"Two and a Half Men\" star made the disclosure in November of 2015. In total, all English-language searches about HIV quadrupled beyond the usual number the day after Sheen's announcement, said a team from San Diego State University. Searches for information about HIV symptoms and testing were about six times higher than normal. And their follow-up research has now found that weekly sales of the HIV home-test kit OraQuick nearly doubled in the week after the announcement. \"Charlie Sheen's disclosure is potentially the most significant domestic HIV prevention event in the last decade,\" said study author John Ayers, a research professor with the university's Graduate School of Public Health. To put the event into perspective, the researchers say that OraQuick sales in the period around Sheen's announcement were eight times higher than sales around World AIDS Day, Dec. 1. That day is set aside each year to help promote HIV testing and prevention. Why does a celebrity announcement have such a profound effect on people's health care? According to study coauthor Jon-Patrick Allem, it's because people tend to identify with individuals, not statistics. \"It is easy to imagine that a single individual, like Sheen, disclosing his HIV status may be more compelling and motivating for people than an unnamed mass of individuals or a lecture from public health leaders,\" Allem said in a university news release. He's a research scientist with the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. Ayers and his colleagues began their research into the effect of Sheen's disclosure on the morning he announced on television that he'd been diagnosed with the AIDS virus. \"We understood there would be some impact from Sheen's disclosure,\" Ayers explained at the time of the 2016 study's release, \"but the exact nature of that impact was unknown.\" The researchers analyzed news stories and Google searches in the years before Sheen's announcement and in the weeks afterward. According to the study, English-language news stories available on the Internet about HIV fell from 67 per 1,000 in 2004 to 12 per 1,000 in 2015. But the number of stories grew by 265 percent on the day of Sheen's disclosure, to around 25 per 1,000, the researchers found. On the day of his disclosure, about 2.8 million more Google searches than usual included the term \"HIV,\" and 1.3 million searches included search terms seeking information about condoms, HIV symptoms and HIV testing. (The researchers came up with these numbers after adjusting statistics so they wouldn't be thrown off by factors such as especially high or low numbers of searches.) \"More searches for HIV occurred on the day of Sheen's disclosure than have ever occurred on any other day\" since Google began tracking the number of searches in 2005, said study co-author Eric Leas, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego. \"This finding is extremely exciting for the public health community. The magnitude of Sheen's disclosure reminds us of the incredible impact that Magic Johnson had on public discourse around HIV in the early 1990s. Sheen's disclosure could potentially have a more pronounced effect,\" Leas added. Why do all these searches matter? Ayers said they reveal \"what the public is thinking and when they're thinking it. We can see that the public is actively engaged in trying to improve their health or health awareness by searching.\" Dr. Mitchell Katz, director of the Los Angeles County Health Agency, wrote a commentary accompanying the study. In an interview, he said announcements like this \"rock the public's sense of denial and make them wonder if they, too, could be infected or could become infected. That is why announcements like this result in people not only googling Charlie Sheen but googling information about HIV prevention and testing.\" The 2016 study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine, while the latest study with data on OraQuick sales, was published May 18 in Prevention Science.

While its too early to tell if heat-not-burn products will overtake e-cigarettes as the new method of smoking, the available evidence suggests heat-not-burn products are poised for explosive growth as they are introduced into new markets.\"", "title": "Decreasing popularity of e-cigarettes could 'open the floodgates' for smoking alternative heat-not-burn tobacco", "content": "", "dir": "cardio_business", "request_url": "https://web.archive.org/save/https://web.archive.org/web/20210616160121/https://www.cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/vascular-endovascular/decreasing-popularity-e-cigarettes-could-open-floodgates-smoking"}

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement. Still, in the wake of the nation's recent spate of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping, a similarly unregulated product, Ayers thinks CBD's online popularity should serve as a call to action for regulators. \"We already saw what can happen with vaping,\" he said. \"Imagine with the demand for CBD, if we have a tainted product out there.\"", "summary": "Searches for CBD spiked this year as awareness of the product grew.

CBD, a chemical found in the cannabis plant, is having its moment, after being seized on by the wellness empire for its rumored ability to help with a whole host of conditions, from anxiety to insomnia to depression. The CBD industry is estimated to grow to almost $2 billion by 2022, and cannabis use overall has increased 43 percent between 2007 and 2015; it's now medicinally legal in 33 states. But despite how ubiquitous CBD lattes may be, they are not matched by an equal amount of research on their benefits for the mind. Advertisement A new review and meta-analysis published this week in The Lancet Psychiatry looked for the effects of cannabinoids on mental health in nearly 40 years of research and their findings sounded grim: They wrote there was \"scarce evidence\" to support that cannabis improves mental health symptoms, leading publications like The Guardian to publish an article titled \"Risks of cannabis use for mental health treatment outweigh benefits,\" and write that \"the use of cannabis medicines to treat people with depression, anxiety, psychosis or other mental health issues cannot be justified because there is little evidence that they work or are safe.\" Time similarly concluded that \"There's 'Scarce Evidence' That Cannabis Helps Mental Health Issues.\" This review reveals something many clinicians already knew: We dont have enough evidence to say that cannabis can treat mental health disorders. That doesnt necessarily mean weed doesnt help at all--it means we just don't know. (And since risks of long-term cannabis use have been well-documented, of course they would outweigh benefits we are unaware of.) \"The old adage that absence of evidence doesnt necessarily mean absence of effectiveness is true here,\" said Harry Sumnall, a professor of substance use at Liverpool John Moores Public Health Institute in the U.K., who was not involved in the review. Finding a lack of evidence isn't a reason to throw in the towel. It should be motivation to conduct more rigorous studies, especially given the rise in use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products specifically for mental health, and the large swaths of the public deciding on their own that cannabis does treat these symptoms. Advertisement People are widely using cannabis--both THC and CBD--for their mental health. In 2017, a study found that people perceive cannabis to be an effective way to treat many conditions, and that some substituted cannabis for prescription medications like benzodiazepines (often given for anxiety) or antidepressants. In a 2018 study of over 2,400 CBD users, 62 percent said they used CBD for a medical condition--the top three being pain, anxiety, and depression. Just because your friend or your favorite Instagram influencer took CBD and it improved their anxiety better isnt enough to determine whether cannabis is effective for that purpose. This kind of evidence is called anecdotal and it can feel immensely powerful, especially if the experience happened to you. But thats not the way we decide that treatments are safe and effective. Even results from single studies might not be enough, especially when it comes to difficult areas like mental health. Consider the fact that researchers are still having debates about whether or not SSRIs are more effective than placebos for depression-- and those medications have been around for decades and have no issues surrounding legality that result in limits on research. This is one of the reasons scientists write reviews and meta-analyses, to try and combine findings from many studies. The authors of the new review searched for studies published between 1980 and 2018, including unpublished or ongoing studies, where medicinal cannabinoids were given to adults to treat depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. In the end, they included 83 studies, 30 of which were randomized controlled trials--considered the gold standard of study design. Advertisement The results were mixed. \"Our analyses and conclusions are limited by the small amount of available data, small study sizes, and heterogeneity of findings across studies,\" the authors wrote. They found that pharmaceutical-grade THC made anxiety symptoms better, but only in people who had other medical conditions like chronic pain. This is an important caveat. If, for example, the primary outcome of a study was seeing if cannabis could help with chronic pain and a persons depression also improved, its hard to say whether the cannabis treated the depression, or if their pain got better and made them feel less depressed. In one study the review looked at, pharmaceutical cannabis made psychotic symptoms worse, while in others, pharmaceutical cannabis didnt show any significant effect on mental disorders, but was linked to increased side effects. The authors noted that there were very few randomized controlled trials for them to review that tested pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis. Another issue is that many people don't take pharmaceutical or medicinal cannabis, they buy it recreationally--the studies can't account for that variability either. \"To make more confident conclusions we need more evidence; but at the moment there is not a lot that can support, guide or inform use of cannabinoids for mental disorders,\" said Louisa Degenhardt, the deputy director at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at The University of New South Wales in Sydney, and senior author on the review. Advertisement Kevin Hill, an addiction psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said that any clinician who treats patients who regularly use cannabis, either recreationally or medicinally, won't be surprised at the mixed and sparse evidence the authors had to muddle through. \"There is much more that we dont know about cannabis and CBD than we do know,\" Hill said. \"With such an intense interest in cannabis and CBD as treatments for medical conditions including psychiatric disorders, it is disappointing that the rate and scale [of research] has not kept pace with the interest.\" Cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug, which is a barrier to research, but funding is a bigger one, Hill said. He thinks that states and companies profiting from cannabis and CBD should contribute to the science. \"For the most part, they have not,\" Hill said. \"A portion of profits from the sale of cannabis or CBD should be put toward finding the answers to important questions about efficacy and safety.\" It's a process we know can work, even for something like CBD: Large-scale trials were how we found that CBD could be helpful for pediatric epilepsy conditions, and it's now FDA-approved for that use. The reason why this all matters is because with mental health disorders, taking something thats not helping could eventually end up doing harm. If someone with depression takes CBD or medical cannabis daily and it doesn't work (or makes it worse), they won't improve. This could affect their overall quality of life, and their ability to work or be social. Advertisement Without more study, we could also be missing some of the basic biology around cannabis use. Earlier this year, a small study looked at the medical records of 25 people who used cannabis and found that they needed more anesthesia to remain sedated during certain medical procedures. When the authors tried to look at existing research to see if other clinicians had found the same thing, they discovered that their study was the first on that topic. \"We did these huge literature searches and found nothing,\" Mark Twardowski, a doctor of osteopathic medicine, told VICE in April. \"Really?\" And many CBD products continue to be notoriously under regulated: In 2017, a study in JAMA found that only 30 percent of CBD products sold online were accurately labeled, and last year, a study in Forensic Science International found synthetic marijuana and dextromethorphan, an ingredient in cough syrup, in CBD vape liquid. \"With millions of Americans using cannabis and CBD for myriad medical conditions, we should be conducting rigorously designed trials to see if cannabis and CBD actually are effective treatments for these conditions,\" Hill said. The United States has the potential to lead the way in this work and we have not yet done so.\" Until more research is done, we should be wary of overblown claims around cannabis on both sides: that it does nothing, or that it's a panacea--our gap in knowledge is too great for either.
