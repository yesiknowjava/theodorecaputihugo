0,0,0,0,10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103133,What Cannabis Can Learn from Covid: Hydroxychloroquine Research Suggests the Next Step for Medical Cannabis Research.,"Because of the massive scale of the Covid-19 pandemic, Covid treatment research is subject to intense politicization, frequent media scrutiny, and continued public interest. As thoroughly described in a recent JAMA Viewpoint Article (Califf, Hernandez, & Landray, 2020), public scrutiny into drug development research has the potential to introduce a new set of incentives into the research process, which can, in turn, disrupt science-based regulation and the delivery of evidence-based treatments. These dangers became abundantly apparent through the US experience with hydroxychloroquine. When influencers and politicians began to endorse hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid based upon early observational and preclinical studies, many in the public, including patients, physicians, and policy-makers, were quick to embrace hydroxychloroquine as an effective treatment, even though observational and preclinical studies are incapable of causally proving a drug's safety or efficacy. This unearned enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine led to shortages for those who required the drug for approved indications (Jakhar & Kaur, 2020) and even cases of poisonings (Erickson, Chai, & Boyer, 2020). Another observational study (which was later retracted) subsequently found a positive association between hydroxychloroquine use and mortality as well as other adverse events, which may have made recruitment for hydroxychloroquine randomized controlled trials more challenging (Califf et al., 2020). Concerningly, the cacophony of contradictory observational and preclinical evidence presented in the media led some members of the public to adopt a dogmatic attachment to the drug's effectiveness or ineffectiveness in line with their political identity (Fuhrer & Cova, 2020). Since hydroxychloroquine was first suggested as a possible Covid treatment, a large-scale RCT, similar to what would be required for FDA drug approval, along with five smaller RCTs have all failed to find that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for Covid. The authors of the large-scale RCT stated on June 5th, “this result should change medical practice worldwide and demonstrates the importance of large, randomised trials to inform decisions about both the efficacy and the safety of treatments” (RECOVERY Investigators, 2020). Despite this causal evidence, many in the public still believe that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment (PolitiFact, 2020), detracting from other potentially effective preventive measures and treatments and fueling conspiratorial theories about pharmaceutical interventions overall (Sattui et al., 2020).",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395921000311,cannabis-covid,IJDP-2021,Original Research,,,,,,,
1,1,1,1,10.2196/19369,Collateral crises of gun preparation and the COVID-19 pandemic: An infodemiology study.,"Background:
In the past, national emergencies in the United States have resulted in increased gun preparation (ie, purchasing new guns or removing guns from storage); in turn, these gun actions have effected increases in firearm injuries and deaths.

Objective:
The aim of this paper was to assess the extent to which interest in gun preparation has increased amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic using data from Google searches related to purchasing and cleaning guns.

Methods:
We fit an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model over Google search data from January 2004 up to the week that US President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency. We used this model to forecast Google search volumes, creating a counterfactual of the number of gun preparation searches we would expect if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred, and reported observed deviations from this counterfactual.

Results:
Google searches related to preparing guns have surged to unprecedented levels, approximately 40% higher than previously reported spikes following the Sandy Hook, CT and Parkland, FL shootings and 158% (95% CI 73-270) greater than would be expected if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred. In absolute terms, approximately 2.1 million searches related to gun preparation were performed over just 34 days. States severely affected by COVID-19 appear to have some of the greatest increases in the number of searches.",https://publichealth.jmir.org/2020/2/e19369/,covid-guns,JMIR-2020,Original Research,,,,,,,

Methods. The 2015 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey included questions for 19 substance use outcomes covering 15 substances. LGBQ adolescents’ substance use was described and their risk relative to heterosexual adolescents was estimated after controlling for sociodemographic confounders.

Results. In controlled analyses, we found that LGBQ adolescents were 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06, 1.19) times as likely as heterosexual adolescents to report any lifetime and 1.27 (95% CI = 1.14, 1.41) times as likely to report past 30-day substance use.

5,5,5,5,10.1097/ADM.0000000000000405,Medical marijuana users are more likely to use and misuse prescription drugs,"Objectives: 
Previous studies have found a negative population-level correlation between medical marijuana availability in US states, and trends in medical and nonmedical prescription drug use. These studies have been interpreted as evidence that use of medical marijuana reduces medical and nonmedical prescription drug use. This study evaluates whether medical marijuana use is a risk or protective factor for medical and nonmedical prescription drug use.

Methods: 
Simulations based upon logistic regression analyses of data from the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health were used to compute associations between medical marijuana use, and medical and nonmedical prescription drug use. Adjusted risk ratios (RRs) were computed with controls added for age, sex, race, health status, family income, and living in a state with legalized medical marijuana.

Results: 
Medical marijuana users were significantly more likely (RR 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50–1.74) to report medical use of prescription drugs in the past 12 months. Individuals who used medical marijuana were also significantly more likely to report nonmedical use in the past 12 months of any prescription drug (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.67–2.62), with elevated risks for pain relievers (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.41–2.62), stimulants (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.09–3.02), and tranquilizers (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.45–3.16).

Conclusions: 
Our findings disconfirm the hypothesis that a population-level negative correlation between medical marijuana use and prescription drug harms occurs because medical marijuana users are less likely to use prescription drugs, either medically or nonmedically. Medical marijuana users should be a target population in efforts to combat nonmedical prescription drug use.",https://journals.lww.com/journaladdictionmedicine/Abstract/2018/08000/Medical_Marijuana_Users_are_More_Likely_to_Use.8.aspx,marijuana-prescriptions,JAM-2018,Original Research,,,,,,,

7,7,7,7,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.01.012,Sex and orientation identity matter in the substance use behaviors of sexual minority adolescents in the United States,"Background
Health sciences researchers are beginning to understand the differing experiences and health risks among sexual minority subgroups (i.e., those who describe themselves as homosexual/gay/lesbian, bisexual, or unsure/questioning). Such research can promote the allocation of resources to high-risk groups and the development of interventions tailored to their needs. The present study extends this line of research to substance use among adolescents.

Methods
The lifetime and/or past 30-day alcohol, tobacco, cigarette, e-cigarette, marijuana, prescription drug, and illicit drug use of sexual minority and heterosexual adolescents was analyzed using data from the 2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Controlling for confounders, separate logistic regression models were fit for each substance use outcome. A simulation-based strategy was employed to report adjusted risk ratios for each substance use outcome for each sexual minority subgroup.

Results
Sexual minority females, particularly bisexual females, were at an elevated risk for substance use. For example, compared to heterosexual females, sexual minority females were 1.35 (95%CI 1.16–1.56) times more likely to have used a substance in the past 30 days, and bisexual females had an even further elevated risk ratio (RR: 1.48, 95%CI 1.28–1.69).

Conclusions
Studying the variance among sexual minority subgroups will help practitioners, advocates, and policymakers identify high risk subgroups. In the case of substance use, this study suggests sexual minority females, particularly bisexual females, should become a target population for prevention and other interventions. The study conducts post-hoc analyses on secondary data, and so these results should be verified in more targeted studies.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871618301170,sexorientation-matters,DAD-2018,Original Research,,,,,,,

Japan, where manufacturers have marketed several heat-not-burn brands since 2014, has been the focal national test market, with the intention of developing global marketing strategies. We used Google search query data to estimate, for the first time, the scale and growth potential of heat-not-burn tobacco products. Average monthly searches for heat-not-burn products rose 1,426% (95%CI: 746,3574) between their first (2015) and second (2016) complete years on the market and an additional 100% (95%CI: 60, 173) between the products second (2016) and third years on the market (Jan-Sep 2017). There are now between 5.9 and 7.5 million heat-not-burn related Google searches in Japan each month based on September 2017 estimates. Moreover, forecasts relying on the historical trends suggest heat-not-burn searches will increase an additional 32% (95%CI: -4 to 79) during 2018, compared to current estimates for 2017 (Jan-Sep), with continued growth thereafter expected. Contrasting heat-not-burn’s rise in Japan to electronic cigarettes’ rise in the United States we find searches for heat-not-burn eclipsed electronic cigarette searches during April 2016. Moreover, the change in average monthly queries for heat-not-burn in Japan between 2015 and 2017 was 399 (95% CI: 184, 1490) times larger than the change in average monthly queries for electronic cigarettes in the Unites States over the same time period, increasing by 2,956% (95% CI: 1729, 7304) compared to only 7% (95% CI: 3,13). Our findings are a clarion call for tobacco control leaders to ready themselves as heat-not-burn tobacco products will likely garner substantial interest as they are introduced into new markets. Public health practitioners should expand heat-not-burn tobacco product surveillance, adjust existing tobacco control strategies to account for heat-not-burn tobacco products, and preemptively study the health risks/benefits, popular perceptions, and health messaging around heat-not-burn tobacco products.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article,hnb-searches,PLOS-2017,Original Research,,,,,,,

Online cigarette dealers have lower prices than brick-and-mortar retailers and advertise tax-free status.1–8 Previous studies show smokers search out these online alternatives at the time of a cigarette tax increase.9,10 However, these studies rely upon researchers’ decision to consider a specific date and preclude the possibility that researchers focus on the wrong date. The purpose of this study is to introduce an unbiased methodology to the field of observing search patterns and to use this methodology to determine whether smokers search Google for “cheap cigarettes” at cigarette tax increases and, if so, whether the increased level of searches persists.

Methods
Publicly available data from Google Trends is used to observe standardized search volumes for the term, “cheap cigarettes”. Seasonal Hybrid Extreme Studentized Deviate and E-Divisive with Means tests were performed to observe spikes and mean level shifts in search volume.

Results
Of the twelve cigarette tax increases studied, ten showed spikes in searches for “cheap cigarettes” within two weeks of the tax increase. However, the mean level shifts did not occur for any cigarette tax increase.

Conclusion
Searches for “cheap cigarettes” spike around the time of a cigarette tax increase, but the mean level of searches does not shift in response to a tax increase. The SHESD and EDM tests are unbiased methodologies that can be used to identify spikes and mean level shifts in time series data without an a priori date to be studied. SHESD and EDM affirm spikes in interest are related to tax increases.",https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article-abstract/20/6/779/3884451,cheap-cigarettes,NTR-2017,Original Research,,,,,,,

leadership education and problem behavior prevention. Both the problem behavior prevention
literature and the leadership education literature were reviewed for studies pertaining to the
development of psychosocial traits. In the leadership education literature this research focused on
the development of leadership potential, as this was considered most closely linked with
leadership education for adolescents as opposed to leadership education focused on honing skills
in established leaders. Because the purpose of this review was to determine if a theoretical
connection exists between two previously unconnected fields of literature, a thorough literature
review was conducted as opposed to a systematic review because it was deemed too
cumbersome. Instead, salient studies from both fields were examined for their applicability to the
other field and the analysis as a whole. The research found significant overlap in psychosocial
protective factors for problem behaviors and the psychosocial traits developed through leadership
education. This paper includes a review and synthesis of the two literatures, as well as
direct comparisons between them. Given that a theoretical connection between leadership
education and problem behavior prevention seems to exist, the author recommends empirical
research to determine if leadership education is an effective and efficient vehicle for problem
behavior prevention. The paper will conclude with recommendations for leadership education

Until recently, HNB products were all but unavailable to consumers—but now may be the perfect time for a thriving HNB market.",https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/26/5/609,hnb-boiling-point,TC-2016,Uninvited Commentary,,,,,,,

Cocaine use became popular at the turn of the 20th century for both coastal elite white Americans and poor southern black Americans. While use among elite whites was largely ignored, individuals in the medical and political community stoked fears that cocaine use was pervasive among African Americans and was a central cause of crime against whites [1, 2]. In the 1950s, amphetamines were developed and prescribed as diet and energy pills for suburban, white housewives, but urban, minority users of the same drugs were berated as ‘speed freaks’ [3]. In the 1980s, Americans blamed a surge in crack use for urban violence and demanded harsh criminal penalties for users [4], and in the 1990s methamphetamine use among poor Appalachian whites generated more abrasive stereotypes than public health action.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.15339,race-opioids,ADD-2020B,Invited Commentary,,,,,,,
27,27,27,27,10.1111/1475-6773.13625,The Impact of Medicare Shared Savings Plan ACOs on Behavioral Health Service Utilization and Disparities in Care.,"Objective
To assess the impact of the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) ACOs on mental health and substance use services utilization and racial/ethnic disparities in care for these conditions.

Data sources
Five percent random sample of Medicare claims from 2009 to 2016.

Study design
We compared Medicare beneficiaries in MSSP ACOs to non-MSSP beneficiaries, stratifying analyses by Medicare eligibility (disability vs age 65+). We estimated difference-in-difference models of MSSP ACOs on mental health and substance use visits (outpatient and inpatient), medication fills, and adequate care for depression adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, and chronic medical and behavioral health conditions. To examine the differential impact of MSSP on our outcomes by race/ethnicity, we used a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) design.

Data collection/extraction methods
Not applicable.

Principal findings
MSSP ACOs were associated with small reductions in outpatient mental health (Coeff: −0.012, P < .001) and substance use (Coeff: −0.001, P < .01) visits in the disability population, and in adequate care for depression for both the disability- and age-eligible populations (Coeff: −0.028, P < .001; Coeff: −0.012, P < .001, respectively). MSSP ACO’s were also associated with increases in psychotropic medications (Coeff: 0.007 and Coeff: 0.0213, for disability- and age-eligible populations, respectively, both P < .001) and reductions in inpatient mental health stays (Coeff:-0.004, P < .001, and Coeff:-0.0002, P < .01 for disability- and age-eligible populations, respectively) and substance use-related stays for disability-eligible populations (Coeff:-0.0005, P<.05). The MSSP effect on disparities varied depending on type of service.

Conclusions
We found small reductions in outpatient and inpatient stays and in rates of adequate care for depression associated with MSSP ACOs. As MSSP ACOs are placed at more financial risk for population-based treatment, it will be important to include more robust behavioral health quality measures in their contracts and to monitor disparities in care.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6773.13625,mssp-acos,HSR-2021,Team Science,,,,,,,

Given the severity of the outbreak, we assessed whether articles during the outbreak era more frequently warned about the dangers of vaping and whether internet searches for vaping cessation increased.

Methods Using Tobacco Watcher, a media monitoring platform that automatically identifies and categorises news articles from sources across the globe, we obtained all articles that (a) discussed the outbreak and (b) primarily warned about the dangers of vaping. We obtained internet search trends originating from the USA that mentioned ‘quit’ or ‘stop’ and ‘e cig(s),’ ‘ecig(s),’ ‘e-cig(s),’ ‘e cigarette(s),’ ‘e-cigarette(s),’ ‘electronic cigarette(s),’ ‘vape(s),’ ‘vaping’ or ‘vaper(s)’ from Google Trends (eg, ‘how do I quit vaping?’). All data were obtained from 1 January 2014 to 18 February 2020 and ARIMA models were used with historical trends to forecast the ratio of observed to expected search volumes during the outbreak era.

Results News of the vaping-induced pulmonary disease outbreak was first reported on 25 July 2019 with 195 articles, culminating in 44 512 articles by 18 February 2020. On average, news articles warning about the dangers of vaping were 130% (95% prediction interval (PI): −15 to 417) and searches for vaping cessation were 76% (95% PI: 28 to 182) higher than expected levels for the days during the period when the sources of the outbreak were unknown (25 July to 27 September 2019). News and searches stabilised just after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a primary source of the outbreak was an additive used in marijuana vapes on 27 September 2019. In sum, there were 12 286 articles archived in Tobacco Watcher primarily warning about the dangers of vaping and 1 025 000 cessation searches following the outbreak.

Conclusion The vaping-induced pulmonary disease outbreak spawned increased coverage about the dangers of vaping and internet searches for vaping cessation. Resources and strategies that respond to this elevated interest should become a priority among public health leaders.",https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2020/10/13/tobaccocontrol-2020-055755,evali-searches,TC-2021,Team Science,,,,,,,

We recorded if IVAs provided a singular response and if so, did they link users to treatment or treatment referral services. Only 4 of the 70 help-seeking queries presented to the five IVAs returned singular responses, with the remainder prompting confusion (e.g., “did I say something wrong?”). When asked “help me quit drugs” Alexa responded with a definition for the word drugs. “Help me quit…smoking” or “tobacco” on Google Assistant returned Dr. QuitNow (a cessation app), while on Siri “help me quit pot” promoted a marijuana retailer. IVAs should be revised to promote free, remote, federally sponsored addiction services, such as SAMSHA’s 1-800-662-HELP helpline.

33,33,33,33,10.1371/journal.pone.0205822,"Next generation media monitoring: Global coverage of electronic nicotine delivery systems (electronic cigarettes) on Bing, Google, and Twitter, 2013-2018","News media monitoring is an important scientific tool. By treating news reporters as data collectors and their reports as qualitative accounts of a fast changing public health landscape, researchers can glean many valuable insights. Yet, there have been surprisingly few innovations in public health media monitoring, with nearly all studies relying on labor-intensive content analyses limited to a small number of media reports. We propose to advance this subfield by using scalable machine learning. In potentially the largest contemporary public health media monitoring study to date, we systematically characterize global news reports surrounding electronic cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) using natural language processing techniques. News reports including ENDS terms (e.g., “electronic cigarettes”) from over 100,000 sources (all sources archived on Google News or Bing News, as well as all news articles shared on Twitter) were monitored for 1 January 2013 through 31 July 2018. The geographic and subject (e.g., prevalence, bans, quitting, warnings, marketing, prices, age, flavor and industry) foci of news articles, their popularity among readers who share news on social media, and the sentiment behind news articles were assessed algorithmically. Globally there were 86,872 ENDS news reports with coverage increasing from 8 (standard deviation [SD] = 8) stories per day in 2013 to 75 (SD = 56) stories per day during 2018. The focus of ENDS news spanned 148 nations, with the plurality focusing on the United States (34% of all news). Potentially overlooked hotspots of ENDS media activity included China, Egypt, Russia, Ukraine, and Paraguay. The most common subject was warnings about ENDS (18%), followed by bans on using ENDS (13%) and ENDS prices (9%). Flavor and age restrictions were the least covered news subjects (~1% each). Among different subject foci, reports on quitting cigarettes using ENDS had the highest probability of scoring in the top three deciles of popularity rankings. Moreover, ENDS news on quitting and prices had a more positive sentiment on average than news with other subject foci. Public health leaders can use these trends to stay abreast of how ENDS are portrayed in the media, and potentially how the public perceives ENDS. Because our analytical strategies are updated in near real time, we aim to make media monitoring part of standard practice to support evidence-based tobacco control in the future.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article,ecig-media-monitoring,PLOS-2018,Team Science,,,,,,,

Seventy-two percent (95% CI: 63–80) of articles quoted at least one participant’s tweet and searching for the quoted content led to the participant 84% (95% CI: 74–91) of the time. Twenty-one percent (95% CI: 13–29) of articles disclosed a participant’s Twitter username thereby making the participant immediately identifiable. Only one article reported obtaining consent to disclose identifying information and institutional review board (IRB) involvement was mentioned in only 40% (95% CI: 31–50) of articles, of which 17% (95% CI: 10–25) received IRB-approval and 23% (95% CI:16–32) were deemed exempt. Biomedical publications are routinely including identifiable information by quoting tweets or revealing usernames which, in turn, violates ICMJE ethical standards governing scientific ethics, even though said content is scientifically unnecessary. We propose that authors convey aggregate findings without revealing participants’ identities, editors refuse to publish reports that reveal a participant’s identity, and IRBs attend to these privacy issues when reviewing studies involving social media data. These strategies together will ensure participants are protected going forward.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0036-2,reverse-identification,NDM-2018,Team Science,,,,,,,

As a result, testing is the most cost-effective HIV prevention strategy and must be accelerated when opportunities are presented. Web searches for HIV spiked around actor Charlie Sheen’s HIV-positive disclosure. However, it is unknown whether Sheen’s disclosure impacted offline behaviors like HIV testing. The goal of this study was to determine if Sheen’s HIV disclosure was a record-setting HIV prevention event and determine if Web searches presage increases in testing allowing for rapid detection and reaction in the future. Sales of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV test kits in the USA were monitored weekly from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, alongside Web searches including the terms “test,” “tests,” or “testing” and “HIV” as accessed from Google Trends. Changes in OraQuick sales around Sheen’s disclosure and prediction models using Web searches were assessed. OraQuick sales rose 95% (95% CI, 75–117; p < 0.001) of the week of Sheen’s disclosure and remained elevated for 4 more weeks (p < 0.05). In total, there were 8225 more sales than expected around Sheen’s disclosure, surpassing World AIDS Day by a factor of about 7. Moreover, Web searches mirrored OraQuick sales trends (r = 0.79), demonstrating their ability to presage increases in testing. The “Charlie Sheen effect” represents an important opportunity for a public health response, and in the future, Web searches can be used to detect and act on more opportunities to foster prevention behaviors.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11121-017-0792-2,sheen-hiv-tests,PS-2017,Team Science,,,,,,,
