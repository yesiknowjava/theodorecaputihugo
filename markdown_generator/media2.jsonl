Font Size: A A A Celebrities are promoting cannabis derived products as part of a growing wellness trend. Kim Kardashian had a cannabidiol (CBD) themed baby shower. Melissa McCarthy used CBD oil to relieve foot pain. Whoopi Goldberg started selling CBD infused products to alleviate \"menstrual discomfort.\" But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the public that CBD products have not been approved by the agency and can expose consumers to serious health risks. In a consumer update published recently, FDA said that current data suggest that CBD products pose human and animal safety concerns. FDA recognized that limited information exists on the long-term safety and quality of CBD products, but stated that the available research indicates that the substance can cause liver damage, interact with other medications, and lead to other adverse side effects. Although CBD can be sold legally in the United States, the products do not undergo FDAs extensive drug approval process. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), substances are considered drugs if they are intended for therapeutic or medical use or are supposed to affect the structure or function of the body. But because many CBD products are not labeled or marketed for medical use, FDA does not evaluate the products before they enter the market. Due to FDAs limited data, the agency said it cannot conclude that CBD products are safe. In a press release accompanying the agencys consumer update, Amy Abernethy, Principal Deputy Commissioner of FDA, said, \"we remain concerned that some people wrongly think that the myriad of CBD products on the market, many of which are illegal, have been evaluated by the FDA and determined to be safe, or that trying CBD 'cant hurt.\" FDAs recent announcements were released in response to CBDs growing popularity and mainstream use. Although CBD--a compound extracted from marijuana or hemp plants--does not produce the \"high\" commonly associated with marijuana, it has been marketed for its purported health and wellness benefits. Based on limited studies, the substance has been advertised to improve overall wellness by helping with common conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, and anxiety. Preliminary data have also suggested that CBD may possibly treat certain types of cancer. These potential health benefits have captured the publics interest. According to a recent study, in April of 2019 alone there were 6.4 million Google searches for CBD. Numerous consumers have shared stories on social media about how they believe CBD has helped them manage their pain or improve their anxiety. The availability of CBD also increased over the past year. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 legalized hemp production, allowing producers to cultivate hemp and extract CBD for commercial products. It is estimated that, by 2022, the CBD market will have grown about 40 times the size of the 2018 market. Although consumers can find CBD oils, foods, creams, and beverages for sale, FDA cautioned that some of the companies selling such products are making illegal health claims. FDA recently issued warning letters to 15 companies for violating the FDCA. These companies allegedly marketed their CBD products as drugs without FDA evaluating or approving the products. The agency said that these misleading claims are a public health concern because people may delay seeking medical care if they think their illnesses can be managed or treated with CBD products. FDA has only approved a single CBD product--a prescription drug that can treat two rare forms of epilepsy. In granting its approval, the agency recognized that the benefits of the drug outweighed the potential risks to the specific patient population. But in the process of evaluating the drug, FDA identified many safety concerns associated with CBD, suggesting that CBD products may not be safe for the general public. For example, FDA noted during the epilepsy drug approval process that patients showed signs of liver damage. Over time, this damage could lead to liver failure, a potentially fatal diagnosis. The agency also warned that CBD can interact with other drugs, reducing the effectiveness of other medications and causing adverse side effects. These health risks can occur without a consumer realizing that damage is accumulating. The agency recognized that these risks can be controlled if a physician is monitoring the CBD dosage and the patients condition. But widespread commercial use is dangerous because consumers are not being tested for potential side effects or screened for drug interactions. FDA also identified areas where more research is needed. The agency said it is \"actively\" working to determine if the products are safe for \"special populations,\" such as children, elderly, or pregnant or lactating women. It is also unclear whether CBD produces side effects from long-term use. To address these safety concerns but also allow research to develop, FDA held a public hearing last spring to gather data about CBD products quality, safety, and manufacturing processes. FDA received over 4,000 comments in connection with the hearing. Many individuals shared personal stories of how CBD has helped them manage chronic conditions like anxiety or inflammation.

One pharmaceutical company urged FDA to establish uniform testing and labeling requirements and remove inconsistencies between state and local regulations.

On the first of this month, the first cannabis cafe in the US opened shop in Los Angeles and is now serving up joints as a side dish to farm-to-table dinners and boasting its own dispensary area for marijuana products. And despite warnings from local health officials, coffee shops in many states have been offering to drop some CBD into lattes - for a small additional fee - to help customers calm down while they get caffeinated up for their days. But those promised advantages haven't been confirmed. Studies have suggested all kinds of potential benefits of CBD, the non psychoactive ingredient in marijuana - but those findings have not been verified. Depending on the state, patients can get a medical marijuana 'prescription' for conditions like wasting disease, nausea, easing chemotherapy side effects, HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, seizures, PTSD, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and more. It's legally allowed, but scientifically unfounded, according to the UC San Diego researchers. And in many states, the non-psychoactive CBD can easily be obtained without a prescription of any sort, like Advil or DayQuil coudl be. 'At this time there are no known benefits for taking CBD over-the-counter,' said Dr Davey Smith, a physician and Chief of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at UC San Diego. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THC AND CBD Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are both derived from the cannabis plant. Together, they are part of the cannabinoid group of compounds found in hashish, hash oil, and most strains of marijuana. THC is the psychoactive compound responsible for the euphoric, 'high' feeling often associated with marijuana. THC interacts with CB1 receptors in the central nervous system and brain and creates the sensations of euphoria and anxiety. CBD does not fit these receptors well, and actually decreases the effects of THC, and is not psychoactive. CBD is thought to help reduce anxiety and inflammation. Advertisement 'CBD is this generation's snake oil, where millions are engaging with the product without evidence of any benefit.' Scientists' skepticism has done little to stop Americans from flocking to the trendy product, which has quickly become the hottest topic in health and wellness, according to the new study. 'When talking to colleagues about our study we often play a game we call \"CBD or\" and almost every time experts are shocked to learn that CBD is more popular or nearly as popular,' said Dr Alicia Nobles a research fellow at UC San Diego. 'Consider this one example. For every two internet searches for dieting in the United States we found there is one for CBD!' The study, published in JAMA Network Open,' also found that there are now nearly seven-and-a-half-times as many unique online searchers for CBD as for acupuncture, five-times more than for apple cider vinegar and over three-times as many as for meditation. CBD searches surpassed vaccination searchers by 63 percent, exercise by nearly 60 percent, veganism by 12 percent, and even its own parent plant, marijuana, by 13 percent. The rise of CBD searchers has been steep, and the researchers predict it will only continue. Searches for the compound increased by 125 percent over the course of 2017 and another 160 percent during 2018. Now, researchers project another 180 percent increase by the end of this year. And the growth of interest in CBD has persisted across all regions of the country. Though its broadly viewed as harmless, some patients have sought out CBD as not just a complement to but substitute for proven treatments of life-threatening diseases, including cancer, a pattern that has experts deeply concerned. 'Some consumers might forgo seeing a physician or taking medications with known, tested and approved therapeutic benefits in favor of CBD and thereby become sicker or succumb to their illness,' said Dr Smith. 'Now is the time to act,' added Ayers. 'Government regulators must step up to the plate give CBD products the same level of scrutiny as other proven medications. 'Moreover, anyone considering taking CBD should know there are no proven over-the-counter health benefits.'", "description": "Some 6.4 million Google searches for CBD are made a month, UC San Diego research reveals.

Art supplies. Vitamins. Adult diapers. All to your door in an anonymous box, and without the need to avert your gaze from the cashier. Apparently, marijuana is no exception -- Americans are buying weed online in droves. This news comes courtesy of a study published today in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. It marks the first time anyone has analyzed online marijuana sales by looking at internet searches and the resulting links. For their study into Americans online pot-purchasing behavior, the research team started -- where else?-- with Google. Specifically, they looked at searches on the platform between January 2005 and June 2017, excluding those from the U.S.s six least-populated states. Advertisement Advertisement First, they isolated all the searches including terms such as \"marijuana,\" and \"weed\" in combination with \"buy,\" \"shop,\" or \"order.\" From that list, they eliminated searches that were clearly unrelated or off-topic, such as \"order weed killer.\" This left them with 12 terms tied to the thing they actually wanted: buying marijuana through the internet. Next, they looked at how often people searched those terms each month. They found that, in the 12 years they studied, searches tied to buying weed online increased by 199 percent relative to all searches on the internet. In June 2017, the numbers soared as *high* as 2.4 million in a single month. The searches werent restricted to particular parts of the country -- all but two states the researchers analyzed saw a growing number of searches each month. Not content to simply track search totals, the intrepid team also wanted to know where their list of terms would take them online. You know, for research. Advertisement Advertisement In July 2017, they typed each of their pre-determined keywords into Google, hit \"search,\" and analyzed the first two pages worth of links. Of those links, 41 percent were to retailers offering mail-order marijuana. For two-thirds of the searches, the very first link led to such a retailer. Their conclusion: People arent just searching for weed online. Theyre finding it. This wouldnt be a problem if buying weed were the same as, say, buying shoes or electronics. Though nine states and Washington D.C. now permit recreational marijuana use, none permit its sale online. Buying online may be more convenient, but there are good reasons why its not allowed. When people buy online, states might miss out on the major financial benefit of legalizing recreational marijuana: taxes. Advertisement Advertisement Even more importantly, its harder to regulate who is buying the weed. In states where marijuana is legal, buyers must be 21 or older, and its far easier for those below that limit to fake their ages online than in person. The studys authors noted in a press release that public health leaders must intervene to prevent these sales, perhaps by convincing internet service providers (ISPs) to remove mail-order weed retailers from search engines. Of course, that wouldnt stop teenagers from purchasing weed if they were really determined to get it. But as U.S. states relax their marijuana laws, the nation needs to take precautions to keep the drug out of the hands of people who shouldnt have it.

Font Size: A A A Celebrities are promoting cannabis derived products as part of a growing wellness trend. Kim Kardashian had a cannabidiol (CBD) themed baby shower. Melissa McCarthy used CBD oil to relieve foot pain. Whoopi Goldberg started selling CBD infused products to alleviate \"menstrual discomfort.\" But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the public that CBD products have not been approved by the agency and can expose consumers to serious health risks. In a consumer update published recently, FDA said that current data suggest that CBD products pose human and animal safety concerns. FDA recognized that limited information exists on the long-term safety and quality of CBD products, but stated that the available research indicates that the substance can cause liver damage, interact with other medications, and lead to other adverse side effects. Although CBD can be sold legally in the United States, the products do not undergo FDAs extensive drug approval process. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), substances are considered drugs if they are intended for therapeutic or medical use or are supposed to affect the structure or function of the body. But because many CBD products are not labeled or marketed for medical use, FDA does not evaluate the products before they enter the market. Due to FDAs limited data, the agency said it cannot conclude that CBD products are safe. In a press release accompanying the agencys consumer update, Amy Abernethy, Principal Deputy Commissioner of FDA, said, \"we remain concerned that some people wrongly think that the myriad of CBD products on the market, many of which are illegal, have been evaluated by the FDA and determined to be safe, or that trying CBD 'cant hurt.\" FDAs recent announcements were released in response to CBDs growing popularity and mainstream use. Although CBD--a compound extracted from marijuana or hemp plants--does not produce the \"high\" commonly associated with marijuana, it has been marketed for its purported health and wellness benefits. Based on limited studies, the substance has been advertised to improve overall wellness by helping with common conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, and anxiety. Preliminary data have also suggested that CBD may possibly treat certain types of cancer. These potential health benefits have captured the publics interest. According to a recent study, in April of 2019 alone there were 6.4 million Google searches for CBD. Numerous consumers have shared stories on social media about how they believe CBD has helped them manage their pain or improve their anxiety. The availability of CBD also increased over the past year. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 legalized hemp production, allowing producers to cultivate hemp and extract CBD for commercial products. It is estimated that, by 2022, the CBD market will have grown about 40 times the size of the 2018 market. Although consumers can find CBD oils, foods, creams, and beverages for sale, FDA cautioned that some of the companies selling such products are making illegal health claims. FDA recently issued warning letters to 15 companies for violating the FDCA. These companies allegedly marketed their CBD products as drugs without FDA evaluating or approving the products. The agency said that these misleading claims are a public health concern because people may delay seeking medical care if they think their illnesses can be managed or treated with CBD products. FDA has only approved a single CBD product--a prescription drug that can treat two rare forms of epilepsy. In granting its approval, the agency recognized that the benefits of the drug outweighed the potential risks to the specific patient population. But in the process of evaluating the drug, FDA identified many safety concerns associated with CBD, suggesting that CBD products may not be safe for the general public.

Pictured: last month Charlie Sheen saved lives by revealing that he is HIV positive, a study claims. On November 17, 2015, the actor publicly disclosed his HIV status on NBC's Today Show. Last year, researchers at San Diego State University published a study showing Sheen's TV appearance sparked millions of online searches for HIV prevention and testing. Now, they have taken that research a step further, showing there was also an uptick with rates of people getting at-home rapid HIV tests - reaching a record high. The team collected data on weekly sales of OraQuick, the only rapid in-home HIV test kit available in the United States, to investigate whether Internet queries (based on Google Trends data on searches with 'test,' 'tests,' or 'testing' and 'HIV') could be correlated with any uptick in HIV testing. 'Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,' said study coauthor Eric Leas. The week of Sheen's disclosure coincided with a near doubling in OraQuick sales, which reached an all-time high. Sales remained significantly higher for the following three weeks, with 8,225 more sales than expected. 'In absolute terms, it's hard to appreciate the magnitude of Sheen's disclosure,' added study coauthor Benjamin Althouse, research scientist with the Institute of Disease Modeling. 'However, when we compared Sheen's disclosure to other traditional awareness campaigns the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" is astonishing.' OraQuick sales in the time period around Sheen's disclosure were nearly eight times greater than sales around World Aids Day, one of the most well-known and longest-running HIV prevention awareness events. The week of Sheen's disclosure coincided with a near doubling in OraQuick sales, which reached an all-time high. Sales remained significantly higher for the following three weeks, with 8,225 more sales than expected. Pictured: the chart from the study of OraQuick sales The team's most significant takeaway, however, is that these findings reinforce their past analyses of Google search data. Using Internet searches alone the team was able to predict HIV testing sales within seven percent for any given weeks. 'Public health leaders are often cautious, choosing to wait for traditional data instead of taking reasonable action in response to novel data, like Internet searches,' Ayers said. 'Our findings underscore the value of big media data for yielding rapid intelligence to make public health actionable and more responsive to the public it serves.' Study coauthor Mark Dredze, a Johns Hopkins University computer scientist, added that 'public health must ready itself for the next Sheen-like event by embracing big media data for decision making.' said. Still, it may be the window has not fully closed on the Charlie Sheen effect, he said. 'Our findings build on earlier studies that suggest empathy is easier to motivate others when the empathy is targeted toward an individual versus a group' said coauthor Jon-Patrick Allem, research scientist with the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. 'It is easy to imagine that a single individual, like Sheen, disclosing his HIV status may be more compelling and motivating for people than an unnamed mass of individuals or a lecture from public health leaders.' Since his diagnosis, Sheen has been vocal about treatment options and side effects. At first, the star started on anti-retroviral therapy, the standard treatment for HIV. But in early 2016, months after his public announcement, he joined a Phase III clinical trial for an experimental weekly injection called PRO-140. From day one he has gushed about its effects. On numerous occasions, he has told Daily Mail Online that he felt an emotional and physical transformation when he switched from 'that cocktail of drugs' to his weekly treatment. And earlier this month he addressed why he was motivated to try an unapproved treatment - revealing his old HIV medication left him with 'borderline dementia'. Speaking to Daily Mail Online, Sheen said he did not have symptoms of dementia until he started taking his first regime of drugs to suppress his HIV. But those symptoms disappeared after he joined the PRO-140 trial. His words came as the drug, which ended its successful phase III clinical trial early this year, is now being assessed for FDA approval. Sheen told the Mail he 'is feeling fantastic now!'", "description": "Researchers at San Diego State University have published a study showing Sheen's TV appearance sparked an uptick with rates of people getting at-home HIV tests - reaching a record high.", "publication": "Mail Online", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4516738/The-Charlie-Sheen-effect-HIV.html", "original_url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4516738/The-Charlie-Sheen-effect-HIV.html"}

New research from San Diego State University predicts that \"heat-not-burn\" tobacco products could soon be flooding American markets. The authors warn that policymakers, anti-tobacco advocates, and the healthcare community need to be prepared for action when the products arrive. Heat-not-burn tobacco products are the latest iteration of electronic smoking. Unlike e-cigarettes and vaporizers, they dont rely on a nicotine-infused liquid (\"e-juice\"). Instead, they use actual tobacco thats heated to roughly 570degF (299degC) using a battery-powered heating element. The tobacco is kept below the temperature of combustion, creating an inhalable aerosol. Heat-not-burn products are currently unavailable in the United States. They are for sale in a series of test markets in Europe and Asia. The most robust market is in Japan, where theyve been available since 2014. Product under study in the U.S. An evaluation of Philip Morris Internationals IQOS, a heat-not-burn technology, is currently under way by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. However, the product must undergo rigorous review because its being brought to market as a \" modified risk tobacco product .\" Modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) is a designation given by the FDA that refers to \"tobacco products that are sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco products.\" To achieve this designation, an applicant must demonstrate that the product has the ability to \"significantly reduce harm\" and disease related to tobacco. It must also benefit overall health on a population level, accounting for individuals who dont use tobacco products. Whether or not the IQOS and other heat-not-burn products can meet this designation remains to be seen. The FDA will make their ruling on the product within the next two months. If approved, the IQOS would be the first device to carry an MRTP designation. Searching for answers Currently, theres a lack of information on heat-not-burn tobacco products. The study authors note that there are less than 30 studies in the medical literature on these devices. On account of this, they turned to nontraditional data, including Google search information to analyze growing interest in the product. \"[Google searches] are probably a stronger indicator of interest than if you just asked on a survey,\" John Ayers, a lead study author and a research professor at San Diego State, told Healthline. \"Here were observing people seeking out information on the product, potentially trying to buy the product.\" Ayers said looking at this kind of data before has previously been able to predict the rise of e-cigarettes, as well as other things such as movie and album sales.

Two years ago, almost no one was searching for them online. \"That growth rate eclipses anything else weve ever seen for any other tobacco product, including electronic cigarettes,\" said Ayers. Researchers said that given these trends, the potential for massive growth both in the United States and around the globe is likely. Why the product is popular The appeal of the product is manifold. It offers a novel new form of nicotine consumption that could be of interest to e-cigarette smokers. It also offers a distinct \"throat-hit,\" a physical sensation of smoking cigarettes, thats sometimes lacking in other vaporizers or e-cigarette models.

Now experts predict that heat-not-burn devices are set soar in popularity. A study suggests they will overtake sales of e-cigarettes, which are used by an estimated 9 million adults in the US and around 2.9 million in the UK. This has caused campaigners to warn there is an 'urgent need' for more research into the health effects of devices which heat tobacco as opposed to burning it. The team from the US analysed Google search trends relating to the heat-not-burn devices in Japan, which was the first country to sell them. Their findings showed a huge surge in demand for the items - rising by 2,956 per cent in the two years from 2015 to 2017. It's now expected that the same could happen in other countries, after the first heat-not-burn device became available in the UK in November last year and products entered the FDA-approval process in the US in May. Experts say they expect a huge surge in demand for heat-not-burn devices (stock image) WHAT ARE HEAT-NOT-BURN E-CIGARETTES? Heat-not-burn e-cigarettes were originally created by tobacco giant Philip Morris International. They were behind a smokeless device known as IQOS, that is said to contain 90 per cent less toxins that ordinary ones. Different from e-cigarettes, the electronic device is used with mini tobacco sticks, in the form of Marlboro HeatSticks or others, as opposed to a nicotine-laced liquid. These are then placed into the device before being heated, which experts say makes them much less harmful because they aren't burning the tobacco. But experts argue that the innovative device will never be safer than e-cigarettes and doesn't appear to be a safe option. Advertisement Study coauthor Mark Dredze, professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, said: 'Heat-not-burn products have quickly become insanely popular. 'Two years ago, there were essentially no queries in Japan for heat-not-burn tobacco, but now there are between 5.9 and 7.5 million each month.' Furthermore, the team found that interest in heat-not-burn tobacco in Japan is rising more rapidly than past interest in e-cigarettes when they were first introduced to market. The study authors added: 'This suggests that as heat-not-burn tobacco is introduced in new markets, its popularity may even eclipse e-cigarettes.' Throat-hit appeal The new products gently heat tobacco to a balmy 260degC to produce a tobacco vapour. Co-author Dr John Ayers, an associate research professor at the San Diego State University, said heat-not-burn devices appeal to smokers who still demand the 'throat-hit' delivered by a regular cigarette. This hit isn't obtained by most e-cigs, because they vapourise nicotine - the addictive part of a cigarette - but they don't contain any tobacco. Independent research is needed Tobacco kills up to half of its users - that's more than seven million people each year, according to the World Health Organization. And while the jury is still largely out on the long-term effects of vaping, heat-not-burn devices are currently only on sale in a handful of places around the world and little is known about their credentials. As with many e-cigs, the devices are produced and sold by the big tobacco companies, eager not to lose business as more and more people quit smoking. Now public health officials who were 'caught off guard' by e-cigarettes, are being urged to get clued up now and set the agenda before the tobacco giants get their first. 'Tobacco companies try to outmaneuver public health protections by creating new products that make tobacco appear less dangerous and more appealing,' said Theodore Caputi, a Mitchell Scholar and the study's first author. 'People were caught off guard by e-cigarettes, for example. Our study is an early warning and a call to action for public health professionals to address heat-not-burn products now.' Campaign group ASH said because of the tobacco industry's 'long record of deceit over the health risks of smoking', there is an 'urgent need' for independent research into these new devices. Smoke released by these heat-not-burn e-cigarette devices contain 84 per cent of the nicotine found in traditional cigarettes, a previous study shows (pictured: the IQOS cigarette by Philip Morris International) HOW MUCH SAFER ARE 'SMOKELESS' CIGARETTES? They've been touted as the safest way of smoking in recent years. But research in May suggests 'smokeless' cigarettes may contain more cancer-causing chemicals than believed. Smoking giant Philip Morris markets its IQOS device, which tobacco sticks can be placed into to be heated, as containing 90 per cent less toxins. However, a study found it contains some chemicals that are strongly linked to cancer in much higher concentrations than previously reported. These included carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, scientists said. While the smoke of this gadget still has 84 per cent of the nicotine found in traditional cigarettes. Advertisement In the mean time, heat-not-burn products must face the same strict regulation as cigarettes said chief executive Deborah Arnott. She told The Sun Online: 'From what we know so far, it is likely heat-not-burn products are less harmful than smoking, but more harmful than electronic cigarettes. 'However, unless and until independent evidence shows that these products are substantially less harmful than smoking, they should be regulated in the same way as other tobacco products. 'Fully independent research and assessment will be crucial if heat-not-burn tobacco products are to be accepted as useful in fighting the smoking epidemic.' Dr Ayers said that tobacco control is 'at a new crossroads'. 'Leaders can reasonably respond to this new data and ready themselves by setting an agenda or wait for big tobacco to set the heat-not-burn agenda for them,' he explained. The new findings are published today in the journal PLOS One.", "description": "A US study suggests heat-not-burn devices will overtake the sales of e-cigarettes after their surge in popularity in Japan, the first country to sell them.

Previous research suggests that stressors related to being closeted or coming out and being rejected by family or friends could contribute to an increased risk of substance use among sexual minority teens, senior study author John Ayers of San Diego State University in California said. For the new study, researchers looked at data from roughly 14,703 high school students who had been surveyed about their lifetime and prior-month use of 15 different substances, including illegal drugs as well as tobacco, alcohol and prescription drugs that weren't given to them by a physician. Overall, LGBQ teens were 12 percent more likely than other teens to report any substance use in their lifetimes and 27 percent more likely to report substance use in the previous month, the study found. LGBQ youth were more than three times more likely to try heroin or methamphetamines at least once, and more than twice as likely to try ecstasy or cocaine, the study also found. Stressors faced by LGBQ teens, such as stigma and isolation, \"may make drugs foolishly appear attractive as a coping mechanism,\" Ayers said by email. \"Even experimentation with these harder drugs can derail a teen's future,\" he said. The vast majority of teens didn't use illegal drugs, regardless of sexual orientation, researchers report in the American Journal of Public Health. For example, 6.6 percent of LBGQ teens had used heroin in their lifetimes, compared with 1.3 percent of heterosexual youth. And, 8.6 percent of LGBQ adolescents had used methamphetamines compared with 2.1 percent of other teens. Marijuana was more common, used at some point by half of LGBQ youth and almost 38 percent of other teens. Teen drinking and smoking were even more common. Almost 72 percent of LGBQ teens had tried alcohol in their lifetimes, as had 63 percent of heterosexual youth. With cigarettes, 47 percent of LGBQ youth said they had smoked at least once, as did 31 percent of heterosexual teens. Just over 11 percent of adolescents in the study identified as a sexual minority: 2 percent were lesbian or gay, 6 percent were bisexual, and 3.2 percent were questioning their identities. The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or sexual orientation might directly influence substance use or impact how much teens smoked, drank or did drugs. Smaller studies, however, have suggested that sexual minority youth are at greater risk for alcohol and other drug use, \"and this large national study strengthens this understanding,\" said Kimberly O'Brien, a researcher at Boston Children's Hospital and Education Development Center and a psychiatry instructor at Harvard Medical School. \"The fact that the proportion of youth who identify as LGBQ is increasing (makes) it even more important for families and professionals to pay attention to this relationship because of the increasing numbers of youth affected,\" O'Brien, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.

Back to Healio Sexual minority adolescents were significantly more likely to report that they considered, planned or attempted suicide compared with heterosexual teenagers in the United States, according to 2015 national survey data published in JAMA. \"Sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or questioning) adolescents are believed to have elevated suicide risks. Studies supporting this claim, however, rarely use nationally representative samples, which is a major limitation given that stigma and prevention resources vary across communities and may influence suicide risk behaviors,\" John W. Ayers, PhD, adjunct associate professor at San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health, and colleagues wrote. \"When nationally representative studies are available, they are not recent. Moreover, studies have ignored the diversity among sexual minorities, assuming all share the same risks.\" To determine suicide risk behaviors among sexual minority adolescents in high school, researchers used nationally representative data from the 2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Participants responded privately to questionnaires via computer that asked whether they had seriously considered, planned or attempted suicide in the past year. The investigators used the answers to compare these suicide risk behaviors between sexual minority teenagers and heterosexuals. Overall, 15,624 participants reported their sexual orientation as heterosexual, gay or lesbian, bisexual or questioning. In the past year, 40% of sexual minority adolescents reported seriously considering suicide (95% CI, 36.4-42.9); 34.9% reported planning suicide, (95% CI, 31.1- 38.6); and 24.9% reported attempting suicide (95% CI, 21.5- 28.2) compared with 14.8% (95% CI, 13.7-15.9) of heterosexuals considering; 11.9% (95% CI, 10.7-13) planning; and 6.3% (95% CI, 5.5-7.2) attempting suicide. Compared with heterosexuals, sexual minority teenagers were significantly more likely to consider (RR = 2.45; 95% CI, 2.12-2.81), plan (RR = 2.59; 95% CI, 2.18-3.04) and attempt (RR = 3.37; 95% CI, 2.73-4.09) suicide, after adjusting for confounders. Analysis of sexual minority subgroups showed that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning teens were all at elevated risk for suicide relative to heterosexuals. Bisexual adolescents were 46% more likely to consider, 40.8% more likely to plan or 31.9% more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual adolescents. Differences persisted after stratifying by sex and controlling for cofounders; for example, 40% of lesbians reported considering suicide vs. 19.6% of heterosexual females and 25.5% of gay males reported considering suicide vs. 10.6% of heterosexual. \"The substantial suicide risks among sexual minorities merits a comprehensive reaction. Policy makers should invest in research to understand and prevent suicide among sexual minorities,\" Ayers and colleagues wrote. \"Clinicians should discuss sexual orientation with patients, and allocate appropriate mental health resources. Caretakers should watch for signs of suicide risk behaviors among sexual minority adolescents, and seek supportive help when warranted.\" - by Savannah Demko Disclosure : The authors report no relevant financial disclosures.", "description": "Sexual minority adolescents were significantly more likely to report that they considered, planned or attempted suicide compared with heterosexual teenagers in the United States, according to 2015 national survey data published in JAMA.", "publication": null, "url": "https://www.healio.com/news/psychiatry/20171219/sexual-minority-adolescents-more-likely-to-consider-plan-attempt-suicide", "original_url": "https://www.healio.com/news/psychiatry/20171219/sexual-minority-adolescents-more-likely-to-consider-plan-attempt-suicide"}

Worldwide, there were 36.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS in 2015--the year Sheen made his announcement. But one epidemiologist notes that Sheen's disclosure may have had a hugely positive effect on HIV awareness. Last year, Dr. John W. Ayers, a computational epidemiologist at San Diego State University, was studying Google searches and news articles during the period around Sheen's announcement. His study, which appeared in JAMA Internal Medicine noted, unsurprisingly, that the number of searches and news stories involving the terms\"HIV\" showed a dramatic uptick in the days following Sheen's announcement. That's hardly a shock. Sheen's admission that he was HIV-positive was covered extensively. But there was another interesting uptick in the HIV-related search terms. Not only did people search more for \"HIV,\" people also searched more for \"HIV\" and \"symptoms,\" \"signs of,\" and \"testing.\" Ayers hypothesized that Sheen's disclosure might actually have had a positive effect on HIV awareness, encouraging people to get tested themselves. In an email to New York Magazine, Ayers was unequivocal: \"Sheens disclosure is the most significant domestic HIV-prevention event in the last decade, even though it was unplanned and was not framed as a public-health event.\" Now, there's even more reason to think that Sheen's disclosure had a positive effect. Ayers and his team were back it at it, publishing the results to a new study in Prevention Science. The study revealed that not only did internet searches for HIV testing spike after the Sheen disclosure, so did real-world action. According to this new study, sales for an HIV testing kit OraQuick hit record highs. The study says \"OraQuick sales reached record highs the week of Sheens disclosure, increasing 95 percent...that week and remained elevated for 4 weeks... \" Just look at the jump in sales. This graph comes directly from the study: The first graph shows the remarkable jump in sales right around Sheen's disclosure. The second graph compares the effect of Sheen's disclosure on OraQuick sales with the effect of World AIDS Day. The study notes that \"excess OraQuick sales following Sheens disclosure were equivalent to about 7 World Aids Days.\" What's OraQuick? OraQuick is one of only two home HIV testing kits currently available, according to the CDC, who write \"The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test provides rapid results in the home. The testing procedure involves swabbing your mouth for an oral fluid sample and using a kit to test it. Results are available in 20 minutes. If you test positive, you will need a follow-up test. The manufacturer provides confidential counseling and referral to follow-up testing sites. Because the level of antibody in oral fluid is lower than it is in blood, oral fluid tests find infection later after exposure than do blood tests. Up to 1 in 12 infected people may test false-negative with this test.\" Getting tested regularly for HIV and other STIs is hugely important. According to the CDC, of the 850,000-950,000 individuals living with HIV in the United States, \"one fourth of individuals living with HIV are unaware that they have the virus.\" And people who are unaware that they have HIV present a twofold problem. First, those who do not know they are HIV positive do not seek treatment--and anti-retroviral therapy has been shown to dramatically increase the life expectancy of HIV patients. In terms of the success of this therapy, also known as the AIDS \"cocktail,\" early detection is key. According to Medwiser, HIV patients who are treated early will live an average of 11 years longer. Second, those who are unaware of their status cannot take steps to ensure that they do not pass the virus on to others, compounding the scourge of the epidemic. So go get tested.

The following was his statement in relation to this while speaking to a crowd of 300 people at Hollywood Roosevelt. \"[The drugs] kept me suppressed and alive, but I struggled with a constant migraine and at times, borderline dementia.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement. Still, in the wake of the nation's recent spate of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping, a similarly unregulated product, Ayers thinks CBD's online popularity should serve as a call to action for regulators. \"We already saw what can happen with vaping,\" he said. \"Imagine with the demand for CBD, if we have a tainted product out there.\"", "description": "Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked between 2014 and 2019.", "publication": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514", "original_url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514"}

The resulting #MeToo movement resulted in widespread sharing on social media, and the new study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, offers fresh evidence that the movement has contributed to a shift in public thinking about these issues, said senior author John Ayers of the University of California, San Diego. \"#MeToo is not the first movement to empower victims of sexual violence, but what is unique compared to past movements is #MeToos staying power,\" Ayers said by email. For the study, researchers monitored the volume of Google searches originating in the U.S. from January 1, 2010 through June 15, 2018 related to sexual harassment and assault. During the last eight months of the study period - after #MeToo began - there were 40 to 54 million Google searches related to sexual harassment or assault, the greatest number of searches on this topic ever recorded in the U.S., the study found. Overall volume for this topic was 86 percent higher during these eight months than what researchers calculated would have occurred in the absence of #MeToo based on their analysis of the earlier years of the study. Searches related specifically to reporting sexual harassment and assault were 30 percent higher than expected over the last eight months of the study. And searches related to preventive training for sexual harassment and assault were 51 percent higher than expected. These results suggest that #MeToo may have reduced the stigma of reporting or discussing sexual harassment and assault, the authors conclude. Google searches may also help connect victims with needed support and health resources, Ayers said. \"Survivors face serious health consequences including physical injury, PTSD symptoms, and emotional trauma,\" Ayers said. \"Yet, public investments in preventing and responding to sexual violence is disproportionately small compared with other health issues.\" However, the authors note, online activity is only a proxy for public engagement with topics like sexual harassment and assault, and more research is needed to determine whether or how the surge in Google activity might relate to meaningful shifts in public opinion or behavior. Its also unclear whether surges in search activity related to sexual harassment and assault were sustained only by the #MeToo movement on social media or related also to media coverage of accusations against high-profile men across a wide range of industries, said Luis Rocha, a researcher at the School of Informatics & Computing at Indiana University in Bloomington. \"This is all new territory and only time will tell with future studies,\" Rocha, who wasnt involved in the study, said by email. \"I would think that what people do online will lead to greater awareness that can in turn lead to changes in workplace environments,\" Rocha added. \"If people are searching online in great volumes for the topic, it means they are interested (even if pinged by the media) in the topic, so I would expect this to have very real impact in all aspects of their lives.\" SOURCE: bit.ly/2EIL2LA JAMA Internal Medicine, online December 21, 2018.", "description": "- Millions of Americans have searched Google for information on how to understand, prevent and report sexual harassment and assault since the start of the #MeToo movement more than a year ago, a U.S. study suggests.", "publication": "U.S.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-metoo/more-google-searches-for-sexual-harassment-facts-since-metoo-idUSKCN1OK28L", "original_url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-metoo/more-google-searches-for-sexual-harassment-facts-since-metoo-idUSKCN1OK28L"}

Yet,<br>\n public investments in preventing and responding to<a href=\"https://medicalresearch.com/author-interviews/sexual-violence-intimidation-go-way-back-primate-ancestors/35825/\"> sexual violence</a> is<br>\n disproportionately small compared with other health issues.

Ayers, PhD, MA Vice Chief of Innovation | Assoc. Professor Div. Infectious Disease & Global Public Health University of California San Diego MedicalResearch.com: What is the background for this study? Response: The greatest barrier to understanding trends around sexual violence is they are largely hidden because victims are unable speak up publicly. Moreover, ongoing monitoring relies on proxies that underreport the scale of the problem such as police or medical records where only the most severe instances or a fraction of all instances of sexual violence are represented. As a result, we know very little about the scale of Americas sexual violence problem. It was this backdrop that inspired #MeToo to call on victims to publicly voice their stories thereby revealing the scale of the problem. Our goal was to, for the first time, assess how this change inspired the public to engage with sexual violence issues. By tracking private aggregate internet search query trends we can begin to understand the scale of public engagement with issues around sexual violence including the precise motivation for a search, such as reporting episodes of sexual violence or learning how to prevent sexual violence. MedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings? Response: Our study reveals that even months after the beginning of #MeToo millions more than otherwise expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. Sexual harassment and/or assault searches increased 86 percent following the #MeToo movement and have remained higher for 8 months. Not only did searches for sexual harassment and/or assault significantly increase -- searches specific to training and reporting also increased 51 percent and 30 percent, respectively, indicating that people were potentially changing their behavior in the post #MeToo era. MedicalResearch.com: What should readers take away from your report? Response: Revealing this record setting and sustained engagement is a call to action for the nation. Survivors face serious health consequences including physical injury, PTSD symptoms, and emotional trauma. Yet, public investments in preventing and responding to sexual violence is disproportionately small compared with other health issues. With millions more than ever voicing their needs, our nations leaders should respond by investing in enhanced prevention training and improving resources for survivors. When victims seek out help online it is imperative they linked to evidenced based and effective resources. The same can be said for seeking out prevention resources. Investment in understanding these needs, developing responsive resources, and disseminating those resources are needed now. MedicalResearch.com: Is there anything else you would like to add? Response: MeToo is not the first movement to empower victims of sexual violence, but what is unique compared to past movements is #MeToos staying power. Eight months since the initiation of #MeToo millions more than expected are seeking out help for sexual violence online. #MeToos sustainability, and our study alerting leaders to this, could yield major wins for the nations public health.

However, on Thursday the FDA panel rejected Philip Morris' proposal that it market iQOS as a lower-risk alternative to cigarettes -- one that would cut a user's risk for disease compared to \"regular\" smoking. But in another decision, the panel said it would endorse a second claim -- that iQOS exposes users to lower levels of toxic chemicals compared to cigarettes.

The FDA is expected to decide whether Philip Morris can sell iQOS within the next few months. The agency is not obligated to follow the recommendations of its advisory panels, but it usually does.

'In absolute terms, it's hard to appreciate the magnitude of Sheen's disclosure,' added study coauthor Benjamin Althouse, research scientist with the Institute of Disease Modeling. 'However, when we compared Sheen's disclosure to other traditional awareness campaigns the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" is astonishing.' OraQuick sales in the time period around Sheen's disclosure were nearly eight times greater than sales around World Aids Day, one of the most well-known and longest-running HIV prevention awareness events. The week of Sheen's disclosure coincided with a near doubling in OraQuick sales, which reached an all-time high. Sales remained significantly higher for the following three weeks, with 8,225 more sales than expected. Pictured: the chart from the study of OraQuick sales The team's most significant takeaway, however, is that these findings reinforce their past analyses of Google search data. Using Internet searches alone the team was able to predict HIV testing sales within seven percent for any given weeks. 'Public health leaders are often cautious, choosing to wait for traditional data instead of taking reasonable action in response to novel data, like Internet searches,' Ayers said. 'Our findings underscore the value of big media data for yielding rapid intelligence to make public health actionable and more responsive to the public it serves.' Study coauthor Mark Dredze, a Johns Hopkins University computer scientist, added that 'public health must ready itself for the next Sheen-like event by embracing big media data for decision making.' said. Still, it may be the window has not fully closed on the Charlie Sheen effect, he said. 'Our findings build on earlier studies that suggest empathy is easier to motivate others when the empathy is targeted toward an individual versus a group' said coauthor Jon-Patrick Allem, research scientist with the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. 'It is easy to imagine that a single individual, like Sheen, disclosing his HIV status may be more compelling and motivating for people than an unnamed mass of individuals or a lecture from public health leaders.' Since his diagnosis, Sheen has been vocal about treatment options and side effects. At first, the star started on anti-retroviral therapy, the standard treatment for HIV. But in early 2016, months after his public announcement, he joined a Phase III clinical trial for an experimental weekly injection called PRO-140. From day one he has gushed about its effects. On numerous occasions, he has told Daily Mail Online that he felt an emotional and physical transformation when he switched from 'that cocktail of drugs' to his weekly treatment. And earlier this month he addressed why he was motivated to try an unapproved treatment - revealing his old HIV medication left him with 'borderline dementia'. Speaking to Daily Mail Online, Sheen said he did not have symptoms of dementia until he started taking his first regime of drugs to suppress his HIV. But those symptoms disappeared after he joined the PRO-140 trial. His words came as the drug, which ended its successful phase III clinical trial early this year, is now being assessed for FDA approval. Sheen told the Mail he 'is feeling fantastic now!'", "description": "Researchers at San Diego State University have published a study showing Sheen's TV appearance sparked an uptick with rates of people getting at-home HIV tests - reaching a record high.", "publication": "Mail Online", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4516738/The-Charlie-Sheen-effect-HIV.html", "original_url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4516738/The-Charlie-Sheen-effect-HIV.html"}

This was abbreviated to lb and drawn with a bar across the top of both letters, to indicate that the I and b were connected. \"As people wrote this faster and faster, it evolved into the hash symbol,\" Houston explains. In the late 17th century, Newton was using the \"lb\" contraction generously, and Houston offers photographic evidence of an elegant scrawl by Newton to illustrate when it started resembling what we now call the hashtag. This versatile symbol--used to indicate everything from weight, numbers, a sharp musical note, and spaces between words by copy editors--found renewed purpose on the internet a decade ago. When open-source advocate Chris Messina first proposed vertical groupings of messages and trends on Twitter by means of the hashtag in 2007 (he wanted a sign that could be input from a low-tech mobile phone) it was dismissed as something for nerds. Today this tagging system is the soul food of Twitter and other social media platforms. In the last half-a-decade, apart from facilitating several successful corporate campaigns--#ShareACoke, #LikeAGirl, #TouchThePickle--the hashtag has become a globally recognized symbol of social crusades. But even at a time hashtag campaigns are ubiquitous, the reach, recall and socio-political ramifications of #MeToo have been unprecedented, at least in urban India. It is #OccupyWallStreet and #IceBucketChallenge rolled into one. While we cant say for sure if it would have been as successful had it been called, say, #WomenSpeakOut or #CallingOutPatriarchy, we do know #MeToos driving force has been its crisp coinage that evokes a sense of community and collective empathy. To rewind from the #MeToo juggernaut of 2018: The MeToo movement was founded by American civil rights activist Tarana Burke in 2006. In 2017, the hashtag went viral--and reached the rest of the world--after actor Alyssa Milano posted a tweet encouraging others to say \"Me Too\". Its worth noting that #MeToo became viral after a celebrity chipped in--and accepting that this is the nature of most contemporary campaigns. Subsequently, its high points have been marked by the role of champions of all kinds. #MeToo scaled up in India after 25 September 2018, when Bollywood actor Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her on the sets of a movie 10 years ago. A few days later, comedian Mahima Kukreja shared her #MeToo story on Twitter, alleging fellow comedian Utsav Chakraborty had sent her unsolicited photos of his penis. Things gathered momentum when the very next day, Sandhya Menon, a freelance journalist based in Bengaluru, shared accounts of incidents of sexual harassment by editors at newspapers she had worked in--former DNA and The Times of India (TOI) editor-in-chief Gautam Adhikari and K.R. Sreenivas, resident editor (Hyderabad) of TOI. While Adhikari quit the think tank Centre for American Progress, Sreenivas too resigned after Menon and six other women sent a petition to Bennett Coleman and Co. Ltd, the owner of The Times of India. Kukreja and Menons accounts encouraged more women to share their stories across entertainment, journalism, art, law, education and advertising. An inflection point, one that propelled #MeToo out of social media to Page 1 and primetime, was when Lounge columnist Priya Ramani (disclosure: she is my former editor), posted that tweet. On 8 October, after another day of women sharing their #MeToo stories on Twitter, she posted a story shed written for Vogue.in a year earlier, when the Harvey Weinstein scandal had broken. \"I began this piece with my MJ Akbar story. Never named him because he didnt 'do anything. Lots of women have worse stories about this predator--maybe theyll share.\" It ended with: \"Well get you all one day.\" A few days later, The Wire published journalist Ghazala Wahabs on-record account of sexual harassment by Akbar, a celebrated former journalist and editor. Five days after Wahabs account, and nine days after Ramanis tweet, Akbar resigned from his post as minister of state for external affairs. In a statement he said \"...a sea of innuendo, speculation and abusive diatribe has been built around something that never happened\". Akbars criminal defamation case against Ramani was another inflection point. With the matter sub judice, when Ramani couldnt file her column for the 20 October issue of Lounge, we responded by running #IamWithPriya in place of her weekly column. I believe that more than the four words, it was the punctuation that was the statement. Newtons scrawl now stood for the weight of a collective. One of the arguments against this three-month #MeToo wave has been that Dalit and Bahujan voices havent been adequately represented in what has largely been an urban, elite movement. It was Raya Sarkar, then a 24-year-old law student at the University of California, who kick-started the Indian arm of #MeToo last year when she published a list of alleged sexual predators in academia. Her LoSHA (List of Sexual Harassers in Academia) effort was radical. Sarkar, who identifies as Bahujan, said in an interview to Mint in October that she doesnt mind how the movement is framed as long as it acknowledges her labour. She stressed its place in a continuum. \"I would like to credit Bhanvari Devi for igniting the #MeToo movement years ago,\" she said on email, referring to the the case surrounding a Rajasthani social workers gang-rape by five upper caste men in 1992 for trying to stop a child marriage. \"Because of her we have the legal recourses to sexual harassment we have today. Due process failed her and she awaits justice even today.\" As #MeToo slowly loses its primetime spot in public consciousness, an important thing to remember is that it is an umbrella term. Countless editorials have tried to lay this out through the year and, yet, every so often, I hear grouses from men about \"distinguishing the nature of the offence\" and \"the ease of anonymity\". And the throwaway statement that they now feel \"afraid\" to talk to women. Do feel afraid. #MeToo is an invisible spectre, present even when it is not. In fact, when Ramani posted that tweet, she did not use #MeToo but instead she ended it with #ulti (vomit). Some might say its the same. #MeToo is an umbrella that goes from a seemingly innocuous, \"Youre very dressed up today\" to pinning a colleague against a hotel room wall against her will. The laissez-faire nature of the movement has given it both volume and opened it up for scepticism. Anonymous allegations cut both ways. For the survivors, it allows a forum to share stories without fear of renewed trauma or social and professional repercussions. For the accused and their defendants, it makes it easier to dismiss the allegations. Last week, Indias most-valued contemporary artist Subodh Gupta categorically denied a series of anonymous allegations against him posted by the Instagram account Scene and Herd. In response to an anonymous allegation against him, photographer Pablo Bartholomew said in a statement, \"With no other context, timeline and explanation beyond the account of the anonymous persons story, it makes it quite worrisome that anyone can name and be anonymous, with lack of answerability or fact. With no facts presented, I am at loss to address or respond to the stated accusation...\" In an email to me, Bartholomew has complained about \"the unfair example of juxtaposing the anonymous allegations against me (not sexual in nature) with those who have been accused of severe sexual harassment\". Bartholomew is on fair ground, except that #MeToo is about breaking the ground. Anonymity is a valid recourse for feminist or marginal movements worldwide (what is political graffiti, after all?). The American feminist collective for women artists, Guerrilla Girls, wear gorilla masks to retain their anonymity and \"to keep the focus on the issue and away from our personalities\". Last week, at a lecture performance at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, Indias largest art event, their video work titled The Guerrilla Girls Guide to Behaving Badly told women to \"be a creative complainer\" and \"be a professional complainer\". It also advised them to \"be anonymous\". There has been collateral damage to women too. Director Shazia Iqbals film Bebaak was dropped by the Mumbai Film Festival because Anurag Kashyap was one of its producers. \"As a survivor of child abuse, several sexual assaults and harassment at workplace, I find it really odd, discomforting, unfair and traumatizing to be at the receiving end of the most powerful feminist moment of our times,\" she wrote. \"Sorry [festival] board members, you missed standing by the #MeToo movement by a mile.\" Its useful to look at the MeToo movement in terms of economist Joseph Schumpeters idea of \"creative destruction\". He describes it as a process that \"incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one\". #MeToo is a crisis of gender--an inevitable outcome of years of building patriarchal capital. It was bound to be gloriously destructive. Some long-term changes have been put in motion. But only applauding the formal developments discredits the movement. There is bad news, sure. Many of the men called out are slowly being rehabilitated without disclosures on how internal investigations were carried out and what was revealed. Netflix, for instance, said it would stick with the team behind the show Sacred Games for a second season after an independent investigation into allegations of sexual harassment against individuals involved with the show. Riyas Komu, a co-founder of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, who has a series of anonymous allegations against him, was seen near the art event earlier this month. He was fondly remembered and \"missed\" in the formal opening address, prompting a spontaneous mini-movement at the festival. But these are not failures of the #MeToo movement. These are failures of systems of addressal and correction--the institutional, the corporate, the legal and so on that are expected to rise to action now. The true success of #MeToo is that womens stories have moved from the personal to the powerful to the political. Its greatest achievement isnt the men who lost their jobs or even their public shaming or the men and women who have been revealed as closet misogynists, but the fundamental shift in what isnt acceptable. Its true success is that women have the language to speak out. While not many women might raise their hands in a room if asked \"Have you been sexually assaulted?\" they can now raise their hands when asked \"Do you have a #MeToo story to share?\" The MeToo hashtag has given women a vocabulary that acts as an arsenal. The hashtag is a versatile weapon. In chess, it represents a move that results in a checkmate.

November 2015 war Charlie Sheen so mutig wie wahrscheinlich selten in seinem Leben. In der &quot;Today&quot;-Show des US-Senders NBC erkl&auml;rte der f&uuml;r seine Skandale bekannte Schauspieler vor Millionen Fernsehzuschauern, <a data-link-flag=\"spon\" href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/charlie-sheen-erklaert-ich-bin-hiv-positiv-a-1063162.html\">dass er sich mit dem HI-Virus infiziert hat</a>.</p>\n<p>Die Entscheidung, seine Krankheit &ouml;ffentlich zu machen, fiel nicht ganz freiwillig. Vor dem Outing hatten Klatschbl&auml;tter tagelang &uuml;ber eine m&ouml;gliche HIV-Infektion spekuliert. Auch erkl&auml;rte Sheen, von einer Prostituierten erpresst worden zu sein, die seine Medikamente fotografiert hatte. Dem wollte er ein Ende bereiten.</p>\n<p>Der Schauspieler nutzte die Aufmerksamkeit des Moments allerdings noch nicht f&uuml;r gemeinn&uuml;tzige Botschaften. Er wies nicht darauf hin, wie wichtig HIV-Tests sind, machte auch noch keine Werbung f&uuml;r Kondome. Und brachte dennoch Tausende Menschen dazu, ihr eigenes HIV-Risiko zu reflektieren, wie eine aktuelle Auswertung zeigt.</p>\n<p><b>Millionen Google-Abfragen, Tausende Tests</b></p>\n<p>Nach dem Fernsehauftritt begannen Millionen Menschen, im Internet nach HIV, Vorbeugung und Tests zu suchen. Die Anfragen erreichten Rekordwerte, <a data-link-flag=\"external\" href=\"https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.0003\">wie eine Untersuchung 2016 ergab</a>. Eine weitere Studie zeigt jetzt, dass viele Bewohner der USA noch einen Schritt weiter gingen: Auch die Verk&auml;ufe von HIV-Selbsttests f&uuml;r Zuhause schnellten in die H&ouml;he.</p>\n<p>F&uuml;r ihre Untersuchung analysierten die Forscher die w&ouml;chentlichen Verkaufszahlen der Tests &uuml;ber einen Zeitraum von April 2014 bis April 2016. Der Effekt war deutlich zu sehen:</p>\n<ul> <li>Nach Sheens Fernsehauftritt verdoppelten die Verk&auml;ufe nahezu, noch vier Wochen lang blieben die Zahlen erh&ouml;ht.</li> <li>Insgesamt wurden 8225 Tests mehr verkauft, als f&uuml;r den Zeitraum eigentlich gesch&auml;tzt.</li> </ul>\n<p>Der Effekt des Fernsehauftritts sei sieben Mal st&auml;rker gewesen als der des Welt-Aids-Tages, schreiben die Forscher um Jon-Patrick Allem von der University of Southern California <a data-link-flag=\"external\" href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11121-017-0792-2\">im Fachmagazin &quot;Prevention Sciences&quot;</a>. &quot;Es ist leicht vorstellbar, dass ein einzelner Mensch wie Sheen, der seine HIV-Infektion offenbart, die Menschen mehr &uuml;berzeugt als eine unbekannte Masse oder ein Vortrag eines Gesundheitsexperten&quot;, sagt Allem.</p>\n<p><b>Genetisches Brustkrebsrisiko: Der Jolie-Effekt</b></p>\n<p>Mit ihrer Analyse best&auml;tigen die Forscher ein Ph&auml;nomen, das Mediziner schon einmal 2013 dokumentierten. Damals hatte die US-Schauspielerin Angelina Jolie sich aufgrund eines erblich bedingten hohen Krebsrisikos vorsorglich beide Br&uuml;ste entfernen lassen und ihre Entscheidung in einem Artikel &ouml;ffentlich gemacht.</p>\n<p>Viele Frauen sorgten sich nach dem Bericht auch um ihre eigene Gesundheit. In Deutschland verzeichneten Kliniken und Institute <a data-link-flag=\"spon\" href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/diagnose/brust-op-bei-angelina-jolie-viele-frauen-sind-besorgt-a-904556.html\">bis zu zehn Mal mehr Anfragen als zuvor</a>. Die Mediziner sprachen damals vom Jolie-Effekt. Davon inspiriert, erkl&auml;rten die Forscher den Einfluss des HIV-Outings auf die Gesellschaft in ihrer aktuellen Studie zum Charlie-Sheen-Effekt.</p>\n<p>HIV-Tests z&auml;hlen zu den wichtigsten Werkzeugen, um die Ausbreitung des Virus einzud&auml;mmen. In den USA wei&szlig; sch&auml;tzungsweise einer von acht der 1,2 Millionen HIV-Infizierten nichts von seiner Erkrankung. In Deutschland ist die Quote &auml;hnlich hoch: Hierzulande trugen laut Robert Koch-Institut Ende 2015 rund 84.700 Menschen das Virus in ihrem K&ouml;rper - <a data-link-flag=\"spon\" href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/diagnose/weiter-kein-rueckgang-bei-hiv-neuinfektionen-a-1121216.html\">davon 12.600, ohne es zu wissen</a>.</p>\n<p>Wer sich in Deutschland testen lassen m&ouml;chte, muss anders als in den USA allerdings noch zum Arzt oder einer Beratungsstelle gehen. Selbsttests f&uuml;r Zuhause, wie sie die aktuelle Studie untersucht hat, sind hierzulande noch nicht zugelassen. Das k&ouml;nnte sich bald &auml;ndern: Das Bundesgesundheitsministerium erkl&auml;rte Anfang Mai, <a data-link-flag=\"spon\" href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/diagnose/hiv-test-fuer-zu-hause-ministerium-prueft-zulassung-a-1146843.html\">&uuml;ber eine Zulassung f&uuml;r den Hausgebrauch zu beraten</a>.</p>", "outline_img": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=spiegel.de", "archived_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616181314/https://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/diagnose/hiv-tests-nach-outing-forscher-dokumentieren-charlie-sheen-effekt-a-1148249.html", "headline": "HIV-Tests nach Outing: Forscher dokumentieren Charlie-Sheen-Effekt", "article": "SPIEGEL+-Zugang wird gerade auf einem anderen Gerat genutzt SPIEGEL+ kann nur auf einem Gerat zur selben Zeit genutzt werden.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement. Still, in the wake of the nation's recent spate of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping, a similarly unregulated product, Ayers thinks CBD's online popularity should serve as a call to action for regulators. \"We already saw what can happen with vaping,\" he said. \"Imagine with the demand for CBD, if we have a tainted product out there.\"", "description": "Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked between 2014 and 2019.", "publication": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514", "original_url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514"}

A recent study finds that millions of Americans are seeking out and finding online cannabis retailers, even if they reside in states that havent legalized the drug -- and even if they arent of legal age. Researchers from several universities monitored Google searches and trends in the United States for queries made between 2005 and 2017, looking for patterns in search trends relating to cannabis products. The team analyzed all searches containing common terms for cannabis, including \"marijuana,\" \"weed,\" \"cannabis,\" and \"pot,\" combined with the words like \"buy,\" \"shop,\" \"order,\" and others. They eliminated irrelevant search queries such as \"buy weed killer.\" Using the most common search queries, the researchers replicated the searches to see what sites showed on the first page of the search engine results. Forty-one percent of all search results for these queries were related to retailers offering mail-order marijuana, usually promising delivery to U.S. customers using a variety of shipping services, including private couriers, the U.S. Postal Service, and UPS. Three out of every four search queries showed cannabis delivery services on the first page of results. \"Anyone, including teenagers, can search for and buy marijuana from their smartphone regardless of what state they live in,\" says lead researcher John W. Ayers, an associate professor at San Diego State Universitys Graduate School of Public Health, in a media release. Overall, marijuana shopping searches increased in the United States by nearly 300% between 2005 and 2017, with the highest number of searches originating from Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and Nevada -- all states that have legalized recreational marijuana sales in recent years. But online sales of the drug are illegal, even in these states that have legalized or partially legalized it. \"Clearly these regulations are failing,\" says co-author Eric Leas, a research fellow at Stanford University. Researchers suggest that officials work with internet service providers to have these retailers removed from search engines as a means to curb illegal sales. Without such action, the consequences could be dire. \"Children could obtain marijuana online without safeguards to protect them,\" says lead author Theodore Caputi, of University College Cork in Ireland. \"States that have legalized marijuana might not be able to collect taxes to offset the public health costs of legal marijuana from online retailers, and the instant online availability of marijuana could increase marijuana dependence among all age groups.\" The study was published in American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Investigadores de la Universidad Estatal de San Diego (Estados Unidos) han constatado que la decision del actor Charlie Sheen de anunciar en noviembre de 2015 que tenia VIH desemboco en una cascada de ventas de test rapidos de diagnostico del virus en las semanas posteriores. Asi se desprende de los resultados de un estudio publicado en la revista 'Prevention Science', que se suma a los de un trabajo publicado hace un ano en otra revista cientifica que ya vinculo dicho anuncio a un aumento de las consultas en Internet relacionadas con la prevencion y el diagnostico del VIH, a pesar de que ni Sheen ni las autoridades sanitarias aprovecharon la ocasion para lanzar un mensaje de salud publica. En este caso, los investigadores recopilaron datos de las ventas semanales del kit de diagnostico 'OraQuick', el unico que se comercializa en Estados Unidos para su uso domestico, y tambien analizaron las busquedas en Google de este producto para relacionar ambos factores con la entrevista del actor en la cadena de television NBC en la que confeso su enfermedad. \"Una estrategia que nos permitio obtener una estimacion real del 'efecto Charlie Sheen' sobre la prevencion del VIH\", ha explicado Eric Leas, uno de los investigadores de este trabajo. Asi, vieron que la semana del anuncio de Sheen coincidio con aumento de las ventas del kit de diagnostico de casi el doble, alcanzando su maximo historico, manteniendose significativamente altas durante las tres semanas siguientes, con 8.225 dispositivos vendidos mas de lo esperado.

De hecho, las ventas del 'OraQuick' en ese periodo fueron casi ocho veces mayores a las obtenidas durante la celebracion del Dia Mundial del Sida que se celebra cada 1 de diciembre, uno de los eventos de prevencion de la salud de mas impacto. Otro de los investigadores del estudio, Jon-Patrick Allem, de la Universidad del Sur de California, reconoce que estos resultados muestran que los casos individuales sirven para generar mas empatia entre la poblacion que cuando se habla del impacto de una enfermedad a nivel de grupo, mas aun si son personajes publicos. \"Cuando un solo individuo, como hizo Sheen, desvela su estado serologico puede resultar mas convincente y sensibilizar mas a la gente que los datos de un grupo anonimo o una conferencia de expertos en salud publica\", ha reconocido.", "description": "La revelacion del actor tuvo un impacto asombroso en comparacion con las campanas tradicionales.

A recent study finds that millions of Americans are seeking out and finding online cannabis retailers, even if they reside in states that haven&rsquo;t legalized the drug &mdash; and even if they aren&rsquo;t of legal age.</p>\n<p>Researchers from several universities monitored Google searches and trends in the United States for queries made between 2005 and 2017, looking for patterns in search trends relating to cannabis products. The team analyzed all searches containing common terms for cannabis, including &ldquo;marijuana,&rdquo; &ldquo;weed,&rdquo; &ldquo;cannabis,&rdquo; and &ldquo;pot,&rdquo; combined with the words like &ldquo;buy,&rdquo; &ldquo;shop,&rdquo; &ldquo;order,&rdquo; and others. They eliminated irrelevant search queries such as &ldquo;buy weed killer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Using the most common search queries, the researchers replicated the searches to see what sites showed on the first page of the search engine results. Forty-one percent of all search results for these queries were related to retailers offering mail-order marijuana, usually promising delivery to U.S. customers using a variety of shipping services, including private couriers, the U.S. Postal Service, and UPS.</p>\n<p>Three out of every four search queries showed cannabis delivery services on the first page of results.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Anyone, including teenagers, can search for and buy marijuana from their smartphone regardless of what state they live in,&rdquo; says lead researcher John W.

But online sales of the drug are illegal, even in these states that have legalized or partially legalized it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Clearly these regulations are failing,&rdquo; says co-author Eric Leas, a research fellow at Stanford University.</p>\n<p>Researchers suggest that officials work with internet service providers to have these retailers removed from search engines as a means to curb illegal sales. Without such action, the consequences could be dire.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Children could obtain marijuana online without safeguards to protect them,&rdquo; says lead author Theodore Caputi, of University

Products Online", "article": "SAN DIEGO -- Buying marijuana products apparently requires little more than a Google search and the click of a mouse, no matter who you are or where you live. A recent study finds that millions of Americans are seeking out and finding online cannabis retailers, even if they reside in states that havent legalized the drug -- and even if they arent of legal age. Researchers from several universities monitored Google searches and trends in the United States for queries made between 2005 and 2017, looking for patterns in search trends relating to cannabis products. The team analyzed all searches containing common terms for cannabis, including \"marijuana,\" \"weed,\" \"cannabis,\" and \"pot,\" combined with the words like \"buy,\" \"shop,\" \"order,\" and others. They eliminated irrelevant search queries such as \"buy weed killer.\" Using the most common search queries, the researchers replicated the searches to see what sites showed on the first page of the search engine results. Forty-one percent of all search results for these queries were related to retailers offering mail-order marijuana, usually promising delivery to U.S. customers using a variety of shipping services, including private couriers, the U.S. Postal Service, and UPS. Three out of every four search queries showed cannabis delivery services on the first page of results. \"Anyone, including teenagers, can search for and buy marijuana from their smartphone regardless of what state they live in,\" says lead researcher John W. Ayers, an associate professor at San Diego State Universitys Graduate School of Public Health, in a media release. Overall, marijuana shopping searches increased in the United States by nearly 300% between 2005 and 2017, with the highest number of searches originating from Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and Nevada -- all states that have legalized recreational marijuana sales in recent years. But online sales of the drug are illegal, even in these states that have legalized or partially legalized it. \"Clearly these regulations are failing,\" says co-author Eric Leas, a research fellow at Stanford University. Researchers suggest that officials work with internet service providers to have these retailers removed from search engines as a means to curb illegal sales. Without such action, the consequences could be dire. \"Children could obtain marijuana online without safeguards to protect them,\" says lead author Theodore Caputi, of University College Cork in Ireland. \"States that have legalized marijuana might not be able to collect taxes to offset the public health costs of legal marijuana from online retailers, and the instant online availability of marijuana could increase marijuana dependence among all age groups.\" The study was published in American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Titled, \"Online Sales of Marijuana: An Unrecognized Public Health Dilemma,\" and published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, the study explores the online marketplace for mail-order cannabis in the U.S. Methodology Theodore L. Caputi, Eric C. Leas, Mark Dredze, and John W. Ayers analyzed Google searches in the United States between 2005 and 2017. The researchers paired the terms \"marijuana,\" \"weed,\" \"pot,\" and \"cannabis\" with \"buy,\" \"shop,\" and \"order.\" Similar, but irrelevant search queries (e.g., \"buy weed killer\"), were omitted. Searches were also geotagged by state, and the study analyzed search activity in almost every American State. Due to data restrictions; Vermont, Montana, Alaska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and West Virginia were excluded. Study co-author, Mark Dredze, told Science Daily the following. \"By studying anonymized, aggregate internet searches and search results, we were able to directly observe the online marijuana marketplace.\" Results From 2005 to 2017, marijuana shopping searches in the United States nearly tripled, peaking at 2.4 million searches in June 2017. The search volume was highest in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Nevada. The overall annual growth-rate for marijuana shopping searches, researchers found, was significantly positive since 2005, in all studied states, bar Alabama and Mississippi. This, authors assert, suggests a growing demand across the nation. Furthermore, forty-one percent of all monitored search results linked to retailers selling marijuana. Retailers occupied 50 percent of the first page of Google search results. However, for some searches, all links on the first page of Google were pointing to online marijuana retailers. Conclusions \"Millions of Americans search for marijuana online, and websites where marijuana can be purchased are often the top search result,\" researchers concluded, adding that \"marijuana can be sold in states that do not currently allow it.\" This, they claim, poses some potential public health threats. Some retailers might sell contaminated products. Moreover, state and local tax revenue - some of which could be used to fund public health programs - could be negatively impacted. \"Anyone, including teenagers, can search for and buy marijuana from their smartphone regardless of what state they live in,\" lead author John W. Ayers said. Although some states have legalized, or at least partially legalized marijuana, \"clearly these regulations are failing,\" asserted coauthor Eric Leas.

MAS IMPACTO QUE LAS CAMPANAS TRADICIONALES DE PREVENCION \"En terminos absolutos, es dificil apreciar la magnitud de la revelacion de Sheen\", segun ha anadido Benjamin Althouse, cientifico que tambien colaboro en el trabajo, que sin embargo considera \"asombroso\" el impacto al compararlo con las tradicionales campanas de concienciacion. De hecho, las ventas del 'OraQuick' en ese periodo fueron casi ocho veces mayores a las obtenidas durante la celebracion del Dia Mundial del Sida que se celebra cada 1 de diciembre, uno de los eventos de prevencion de la salud de mas impacto. Otro de los investigadores del estudio, Jon-Patrick Allem, de la Universidad del Sur de California, reconoce que estos resultados muestran que los casos individuales sirven para generar mas empatia entre la poblacion que cuando se habla del impacto de una enfermedad a nivel de grupo, mas aun si son personajes publicos. \"Cuando un solo individuo, como hizo Sheen, desvela su estado serologico puede resultar mas convincente y sensibilizar mas a la gente que los datos de un grupo anonimo o una conferencia de expertos en salud publica\", ha reconocido.", "description": "Investigadores de la Universidad Estatal de San Diego (Estados Unidos) han constatado que la decision del...", "publication": "infosalus.com", "url": "https://www.infosalus.com/asistencia/noticia-efecto-charlie-sheen-disparo-diagnostico-vih-20170521083837.html", "original_url": "https://www.infosalus.com/asistencia/noticia-efecto-charlie-sheen-disparo-diagnostico-vih-20170521083837.html"}

In an interview, he said announcements like this \"rock the public's sense of denial and make them wonder if they, too, could be infected or could become infected. That is why announcements like this result in people not only googling Charlie Sheen but googling information about HIV prevention and testing.\" The 2016 study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine, while the latest study with data on OraQuick sales, was published May 18 in Prevention Science.

It should be motivation to conduct <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/study-on-the-treatment-of-mental-health-conditions-using-medical-cannabis/\">more rigorous studies</a>, especially given the rise in use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products specifically for mental health, and the large swaths of the public deciding on their own that cannabis <em>does</em> treat these symptoms.</p>\n<p>People are widely using cannabis&mdash;both THC and CBD&mdash;for their mental health. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395917300130?via%3Dihub\">a study</a> found that people perceive cannabis to be an effective way to treat many conditions, and that some substituted cannabis for prescription medications like benzodiazepines (often given for anxiety) or antidepressants. In a 2018 study of <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2018.0006\">over 2,400 CBD users</a>, 62 percent said they used CBD for a medical condition&mdash;the top three being pain, anxiety, and depression.</p>\n<p>Just because your friend or your favorite Instagram influencer took CBD and it improved their anxiety better isn&rsquo;t enough to determine whether cannabis is effective for that purpose. This kind of evidence is called <em>anecdotal</em> and it can feel immensely powerful, especially if the experience happened to you. But that&rsquo;s not the way we decide that treatments are safe and effective. Even results from single studies might not be enough, especially when it comes to difficult areas like mental health. Consider the fact that researchers <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325767.php\">are still</a> <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e024886.full\">having debates</a> about whether or not SSRIs are more effective than placebos for depression&mdash; and those medications have been around for decades <em>and</em> have no issues surrounding legality that result in limits on research. This is one of the reasons scientists write reviews and meta-analyses, to try and combine findings from many studies.</p>\n<p>The authors of the new review searched for studies published between 1980 and 2018, including unpublished or ongoing studies, where medicinal cannabinoids were given to adults to treat depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. In the end, they included 83 studies, 30 of which were randomized controlled trials&mdash;considered the gold standard of study design.</p>\n<p>The results were mixed. &quot;Our analyses and conclusions are limited by the small amount of available data, small study sizes, and heterogeneity of findings across studies,&quot; the authors wrote.</p>\n<p>They found that pharmaceutical-grade THC made anxiety symptoms better, but only in people who had other medical conditions like chronic pain. This is an important caveat. If, for example, the primary outcome of a study was seeing if cannabis could help with chronic pain and a person&rsquo;s depression also improved, it&rsquo;s hard to say whether the cannabis treated the depression, or if their pain got better and made them feel less depressed.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/videos/5a/28/5a2871ae177dd46a436f1f25/5a2871ae177dd46a436f1f25-1512684719641.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center\"></img></figure>\n<p>In one study the review looked at, pharmaceutical cannabis made psychotic symptoms <em>worse</em>, while in others, pharmaceutical cannabis didn&rsquo;t show any significant effect on mental disorders, but was linked to increased side effects.

CBD, a chemical found in the cannabis plant, is having its moment, after being seized on by the wellness empire for its rumored ability to help with a whole host of conditions, from anxiety to insomnia to depression. The CBD industry is estimated to grow to almost $2 billion by 2022, and cannabis use overall has increased 43 percent between 2007 and 2015; it's now medicinally legal in 33 states. But despite how ubiquitous CBD lattes may be, they are not matched by an equal amount of research on their benefits for the mind. Advertisement A new review and meta-analysis published this week in The Lancet Psychiatry looked for the effects of cannabinoids on mental health in nearly 40 years of research and their findings sounded grim: They wrote there was \"scarce evidence\" to support that cannabis improves mental health symptoms, leading publications like The Guardian to publish an article titled \"Risks of cannabis use for mental health treatment outweigh benefits,\" and write that \"the use of cannabis medicines to treat people with depression, anxiety, psychosis or other mental health issues cannot be justified because there is little evidence that they work or are safe.\" Time similarly concluded that \"There's 'Scarce Evidence' That Cannabis Helps Mental Health Issues.\" This review reveals something many clinicians already knew: We dont have enough evidence to say that cannabis can treat mental health disorders. That doesnt necessarily mean weed doesnt help at all--it means we just don't know. (And since risks of long-term cannabis use have been well-documented, of course they would outweigh benefits we are unaware of.) \"The old adage that absence of evidence doesnt necessarily mean absence of effectiveness is true here,\" said Harry Sumnall, a professor of substance use at Liverpool John Moores Public Health Institute in the U.K., who was not involved in the review. Finding a lack of evidence isn't a reason to throw in the towel. It should be motivation to conduct more rigorous studies, especially given the rise in use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products specifically for mental health, and the large swaths of the public deciding on their own that cannabis does treat these symptoms. Advertisement People are widely using cannabis--both THC and CBD--for their mental health. In 2017, a study found that people perceive cannabis to be an effective way to treat many conditions, and that some substituted cannabis for prescription medications like benzodiazepines (often given for anxiety) or antidepressants. In a 2018 study of over 2,400 CBD users, 62 percent said they used CBD for a medical condition--the top three being pain, anxiety, and depression. Just because your friend or your favorite Instagram influencer took CBD and it improved their anxiety better isnt enough to determine whether cannabis is effective for that purpose. This kind of evidence is called anecdotal and it can feel immensely powerful, especially if the experience happened to you. But thats not the way we decide that treatments are safe and effective. Even results from single studies might not be enough, especially when it comes to difficult areas like mental health. Consider the fact that researchers are still having debates about whether or not SSRIs are more effective than placebos for depression-- and those medications have been around for decades and have no issues surrounding legality that result in limits on research. This is one of the reasons scientists write reviews and meta-analyses, to try and combine findings from many studies. The authors of the new review searched for studies published between 1980 and 2018, including unpublished or ongoing studies, where medicinal cannabinoids were given to adults to treat depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. In the end, they included 83 studies, 30 of which were randomized controlled trials--considered the gold standard of study design. Advertisement The results were mixed. \"Our analyses and conclusions are limited by the small amount of available data, small study sizes, and heterogeneity of findings across studies,\" the authors wrote. They found that pharmaceutical-grade THC made anxiety symptoms better, but only in people who had other medical conditions like chronic pain. This is an important caveat. If, for example, the primary outcome of a study was seeing if cannabis could help with chronic pain and a persons depression also improved, its hard to say whether the cannabis treated the depression, or if their pain got better and made them feel less depressed. In one study the review looked at, pharmaceutical cannabis made psychotic symptoms worse, while in others, pharmaceutical cannabis didnt show any significant effect on mental disorders, but was linked to increased side effects. The authors noted that there were very few randomized controlled trials for them to review that tested pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis. Another issue is that many people don't take pharmaceutical or medicinal cannabis, they buy it recreationally--the studies can't account for that variability either. \"To make more confident conclusions we need more evidence; but at the moment there is not a lot that can support, guide or inform use of cannabinoids for mental disorders,\" said Louisa Degenhardt, the deputy director at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at The University of New South Wales in Sydney, and senior author on the review.

Campaign group ASH said due to the tobacco industry's \"long record of deceit over the health risks of smoking\", there's an \"urgent need\" for more research into these new devices. As with many e-cigs, the devices are made and sold by the big tobacco companies, eager not to lose business as more and more people stub out their habit. The new method gently heats tobacco to a balmy 260C to produce a tobacco vapour. 5 They gently heat tobacco, creating a vapour that delivers a hit that e-cigarettes, which only contain nicotine, don't Credit: Getty - Contributor Dr John Ayers, an associate research professor at the San Diego State University, said they appeal to smokers who still demand the \"throat-hit\" delivered by a regular cigarette, but not by most e-cigs. That's because e-cigarettes vapourise nicotine - the addictive part of a cigarette - but don't contain any tobacco. Now a new study, led by Dr Ayers, looks at the potential new fad. Heat-not-burn devices are currently only on sale in a handful of places around the world, and so little is known about their appeal. 5 In the UK alone, smoking kills nearly 100,000 people each year Credit: Getty - Contributor The first device became available in the UK in November last year. Dr Ayers and his team turned to Google, to look at search trends relating to the products in Japan - the first country to sell them. Their findings showed a huge surge in demand for the heat-not-burn devices - rising by 2,956 per cent in the two years from 2015 to 2017. The study's co-author, Professor Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said: \"Heat-not-burn products have quickly become insanely popular. From what we know so far, it is likely heat-not-burn products are less harmful than smoking, but more harmful than electronic cigarettes Deborah Arnott, ASH \"Two years ago there were essentially no enquiries in Japan for heat-not-burn tobacco, but now there are between 5.9 and 7.5 million each month.\" And the team noted interest in the heat-not-burn devices in Japan is growing faster than it did for e-cigs, when they first hit the market. The study authors added: \"This suggests that as heat-not-burn tobacco is introduced in new markets, its popularity may even eclipse e-cigarettes.\" But the researchers urged public health officials to get clued up now, after many were taken by surprise by the surge in demand for e-cigs. 5 Experts believe heat-not-burn products are less dangerous than fags, but more harmful that e-cigs, but insist more research is needed Credit: Getty - Contributor Dr Theodore Caputi, from the University of Pennsylvannia, said tobacco firms are constantly \"trying to outmanoeuvre public health protections\" by creating new products \"that make tobacco appear less dangerous and more appealing\". He said: \"People were caught off guard by e-cigarettes, for example. \"Our study is an early warning and a call to action for public health professionals to address heat-not-burn products now.\" Deborah Arnott, chief executive of ASH, agreed and said until more independent research is done, heat-not-burn products must face the same strict regulation as cigarettes. She told The Sun Online: \"From what we know so far, it is likely heat-not-burn products are less harmful than smoking, but more harmful than electronic cigarettes. \"However, unless and until independent evidence shows that these products are substantially less harmful than smoking, they should be regulated in the same way as other tobacco products. \"Fully independent research and assessment will be crucial if heat-not-burn tobacco products are to be accepted as useful in fighting the smoking epidemic.\" In the UK alone smoking kills nearly 100,000 people each year. And globally in the 20th century the habit claimed the lives of 100 million people - more than World Wars I and II combined. 5 Experts urged public health officials to act now to set the agenda on heat-not-burn products, before the tobacco giants get their first Credit: Getty - Contributor Eric Leas, from Stanford Unversity, echoed Ms Arnott's call for further studies, adding: \"There's a tremendous amount we need to learn about heat-not-burn tobacco.\" As did Joanna Cohen, from the Johns Hopkins Institute for Global Tobacco Control. She said big questions remain over the device's potential to harm a smoker's health, and added they should be subject to the same harsh restrictions as cigarettes. \"Given heat-not-burn is a tobacco product, all existing policies to protect the public from other tobacco products should be enforced,\" she said. Given heat-not-burn is a tobacco product, all existing policies to protect the public from other tobacco products should be enforced Joanna Cohen, Johns Hopkins University Dr Ayers added: \"Tobacco control is at a new crossroads. \"Leaders can reasonably respond to this new data and ready themselves by setting an agenda or wait for big tobacco to set the heat-not-burn agenda for them.\" A study published this summer found e-cigarettes do help smokers quit - and more should switch to vaping for the sake of their health. But, like with these new products, experts have warned more research is needed to determine the safety of e-cigs. Another piece of research found just one puff of a e-cigarettes could increase a vaper's risk of heart attack. Public Health England and the Royal College of Physicians believe it is in the interests of public health to promote the use of e-cigs as a way to encourage smokers to quit. The new findings are published today in the journal PLOS One. Responding to the study, Peter Nixon, MD of Philip Morris Limited, hailed the findings \"encouraging\". \"We agree with the study authors that smokers should have access to accurate, scientifically substantiated information about the relative risk of different tobacco and nicotine products so that they can make informed choices,\" he told The Sun Online. \"Encouraging smokers who would otherwise continue to use cigarettes to instead switch to less risky alternatives is an important strategy that can complement existing tobacco control measures.\"", "description": "HEAT-not-burn tobacco products should face the same restrictions as traditional fags, campaigners warn.

Jayes, a behavioral health therapist, is also an urban farmer and embroidery artist.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em> How was your transitioning process? Was it overall very difficult? Why? How long did it last?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>As a non binary person, I have a flexible view of how individuals develop their gender identity. It&rsquo;s something that may evolve throughout a person&rsquo;s lifetime, based on experiences; changes in personal values and relationships; bodily changes; and other factors. Gender identity also intersects and interacts with many other identities, such as race, ethnicity, physical ability or disability, sexual orientation and class.</p>\n<p>For many trans folks, the gender transition process is lifelong and never-ending! Pronouns can change multiple times (hence the &ldquo;pronoun check&rdquo; posts we see on Facebook). Similarly, physical changes or adjustments may happen over years, instead of all at once. I mention this before bringing up my own story because it is important to normalize the idea of flexible, changing genders. After all, gender is a social construct designed to categorize people. When we view gender on a continuum, we can recognize a galaxy of gender journeys that a person can take.</p>\n<p>My own transition is a prime example. I came out as genderqueer in 2012, and used &ldquo;they/them&rdquo; pronouns exclusively. In 2015, after further introspection, I realized that I wanted to live in a more masculine body. I came out to my family and friends as a non-binary trans man, using &ldquo;he&rdquo; pronouns and physically transitioning. I made this decision with the understanding that I wasn&rsquo;t transitioning because I identified as a &ldquo;man&rdquo; per se, but that I felt more comfortable in a body that had more masculine characteristics. Since physically transitioning seven years ago, I&rsquo;ve passed as male about 90% of the time. (Masks can sometimes make passing complicated for trans folks!) When people ask me nowadays what my gender is, I just say &ldquo;non-binary,&rdquo; and that my pronouns are &ldquo;he or they &mdash; either as fine.&rdquo; I am leaning into presenting as femme or as masc as I want on any given day, and being as gay as I want. It can be tempting to present in a way that is more conventionally masculine or feminine, because sometimes it is just easier (fewer questions, comments, or worse). But if COVID-19 has taught me anything, it is that time is not guaranteed, and we must consider what makes life worth living, and embrace it. Every time Pride Month rolls around, I recommit to my true self. But this year it feels all the more important.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Throughout the transitioning journey, many clients are informed of possible negative side effects. Despite hearing about them, you still decided to transition. Why?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I have ever made. Like many trans people, I didn&rsquo;t initially know what being transgender meant. I had to do a lot of research, introspection and support group work before I realized that being transgender described how I felt. When deciding whether to physically transition, a person can do research about the changes that they may experience, talk to other people that have gone through similar changes, and seek individual or group therapy for support. I decided to physically transition after weighing my options based on the information that I gathered, the changes that I wanted, and my financial budget.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there is a lot of information and help available. Trans folks are resourceful, and do a lot to support and inform our communities. For example, there are numerous databases developed by trans people for trans people that allow you to review different surgeons or healthcare providers; compare photos or results of surgeries; and share resources and educational information about physically transitioning. Many community mental health centers have legal clinics that help people navigate the name and gender marker change process.</p>\n<p>One side effect that I didn&rsquo;t entirely understand until after I transitioned was the significant impact that being transgender has on how we navigate the world. It affects where we go to school and receive healthcare, even which streets we choose to walk down late at night. On a job interview, we often feel the need to consider, &ldquo;Will people here be accepting of me? Will there be a restroom that I can safely use?&rdquo; As a white and masculine-adjacent person, my navigation of the world is privileged based on systems of white supremacy. I will not for a second forget the trans women of color who paved the way for us to demand justice; their leadership &mdash; and that of their successors in our movements &mdash; must be recognized.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>Did you have, or do you currently have, any regrets about transitioning?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>What I think this question is getting at is, &ldquo;How do you know you&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; This was a question that I asked myself many times as I considered making irreversible (or at least, not easily reversible) changes to my body. My answer to that is: I didn&rsquo;t truly know it was right until after I did it. That may seem radical or scary. One may ask, &ldquo;Why on earth would you do something so permanent if you weren&rsquo;t sure?&rdquo; But It took a leap of faith. And, as someone who has been there, I can say that if it doesn&rsquo;t feel right, you know. It is important to trust yourself and your bodily autonomy. Also, if you decide to stop your physical transition, you don&rsquo;t need to think of it as &ldquo;de-transitioning.&rdquo; The path of your gender journey is unique to you. You call the shots.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>How has transitioning helped you and your image of yourself? How has it affected your self-esteem and mental health?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Much of what is written about trans people focuses on the challenges of being trans. While I said that deciding to transition was one of the most important and difficult decisions I ever made, it was also one of the best ones I ever made. I love being trans! Trans people are unique, creative, and resilient. Trans culture is rooted in grassroots community organizing. It is humbling to think of all the amazing thinkers, writers, and artists who walked this journey. I have had the privilege to meet a lot of amazing trans people who remind me of the power of our community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><em>What advice would you give to other people who want to follow the path you did?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Despite what society tells you about bodies and gender, there are no rules! You don&rsquo;t have to justify or explain to anyone your decision to transition. You&rsquo;re in the driver&rsquo;s seat. Your body belongs to you and no one else. You will live in your body for the rest of your life. Therefore, you get to decide on what terms you will occupy it.</p>\n<p><em>This article is part of our 2021 Youth Pride Issue in partnership with <a data-id=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\" data-type=\"URL\" href=\"https://urbanhealthmedia.org/\">Urban Health Media</a>. </em></p>", "outline_img": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=washingtonblade.com", "archived_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616200004/https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/", "headline": "", "article": "", "description": null, "publication": null, "url": "https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/", "original_url": "https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/12/23/lgb-teens-suicidal-study/"}

But Sheen didn't make an immediate call to action for the public to get tested or use condoms, and public health groups didn't use him as a face to raise HIV awareness.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Sheen's disclosure was an example of how -- without the celebrity or public health leaders calling for action -- the public appeared to still respond based on health information that was widely known, Ayers said.</p>\n<p>&quot;When Magic Johnson made his disclosure, there wasn't a similar reaction. There couldn't be, because people didn't know what to do,&quot; Ayers said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Remember, people (were) asking, 'Can he play basketball?' 'Can I shake his hand?' There wasn't this trove of information about HIV, HIV prevention and HIV testing. When Sheen disclosed, there was this trove of information,&quot; he said. &quot;We saw people seeking out information on the signs of HIV, HIV testing and how to prevent HIV by using condoms. We saw this trilogy of reaction that is fairly consistent with what public health has been promoting for 20-plus years.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kami Kosenko, an associate professor of health communication at North Carolina State University, said that she believes actress Angelina Jolie's 2013 announcement of <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/14/showbiz/angelina-jolie-double-mastectomy/\">a double mastectomy</a> to prevent breast cancer also had a positive influence on public health, despite possibly influencing an uptick in unnecessary genetic testing.</p>\n<p>Jolie said she made her decision because <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/14/health/jolie-what-is-brca/\">she has a mutation in her BRCA1 gene</a>.

This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, 'pro-vaccine' and for years I have been wrongly branded as 'anti-vaccine,' &quot; McCarthy wrote.</p>\n<p>&quot;My beautiful son, Evan, inspired this mother to question the 'one size fits all' philosophy of the recommended vaccine schedule,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I embarked on this quest not only for myself and my family, but for countless parents who shared my desire for knowledge that could lead to options and alternate schedules, but never to eliminate the vaccines.&quot;</p>\n<p>Research shows that <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/01/health/vaccines-for-kids-safe/\">side effects from vaccines are rare</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> has repeatedly stated that there is no link between vaccines and autism.</p>\n<p>&quot;She is actually recommending practices that are unhealthful and potentially dangerous,&quot; Hoffman said about McCarthy's stance on changing vaccine schedules.</p>\n<p>&quot;Recommending to people not to vaccinate their children means not only are the children being subjected to unnecessary harm, but many others around those children who might not be able to get vaccinated for legitimate reasons are put at an additional risk ask well,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not only unfair to the children who aren't being vaccinated, but also to the many people who can't be vaccinated, who interact with those children.&quot;</p>\n<p>Even though they are vulnerable to illness, some people may not be able to get certain vaccines based on age, an allergy or pre-existing health condition, or other factors, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/adultvaccinations/\">according to the CDC</a>.</p>\n<p>Public health experts also have accused actress Gwyneth Paltrow of spreading some questionable health tips through her lifestyle blog, goop.</p>\n<p>In a written statement, goop spokeswoman Noora Raj Brown described the website as pushing &quot;new ideas into the conversation&quot; in health and wellness.</p>\n<p>&quot;We have a disclaimer on the bottom of every article that states the purpose is to highlight alternative studies and induce conversation.

Hoffman said that the money could be better spent on buying nutritious foods or a gym membership.</p>\n<p>&quot;Do celebrities have an impact on health outcomes? We know they do. ... There's so many studies out there that have demonstrated that when celebrities either give helpful or harmful advice to people, it's routinely followed,&quot; Hoffman said.</p>\n<p>&quot;I do blame celebrities, because they need to recognize the impact they can have and the potential harm that can result from it,&quot; he said. &quot;I definitely blame those who are spreading misinformation.&quot;</p>\n<h3>How celebrities have hacked public health talks</h3>\n<p>Hoffman and his colleagues published a <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f7151\">review paper in the British Medical Journal</a> to analyze the influence celebrities have on people's health decisions through the factors of economics, marketing, psychology and sociology.</p>\n<p>&quot;In marketing literature, they talk about a halo effect around celebrities, whereby people have a very positive view of celebrities, and when celebrities endorse a product or recommend a particular health practice, it transfers their golden glow from the celebrity to the products or practice,&quot; Hoffman said.</p>\n<p>&quot;In economics literature, there's recognition of something called signaling, which is whereby in a marketplace filled with competing ideas, people are constantly looking for a shortcut in order to identify which products or practices they should be following, and so a celebrity endorsing a product provides a cognitive shortcut to an otherwise very complicated decision,&quot; he said. &quot;There is increasing recognition of the role of social networks, and there's few people who have bigger social networks than celebrities. Just think of the number of Twitter followers some celebrities have cultivated.&quot;</p>\n<p>However, Ayers, author of the latest study, said it might not be that complicated.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's not so much about a celebrity effect,&quot; he said, adding that when celebrities speak out about health-related issues, it may resonate because they are speaking as humans with just as much vulnerability to health impacts as anyone else.</p>\n<p>&quot;Typically, public health uses top-down strategies. The most effective messages are believed to come from the experts, 'from the top.' The people who know the most about the subject, the people who are paid to sit around and think about the subject,&quot; Ayers said.</p>\n<p>&quot;It turns out, though, that if you look at the Sheen effect and if you look at these other examples of organic media events ... that's not the case. These messages, they come from the bottom; they come from ordinary people. People who aren't health experts. Sheen might be a celebrity, but he's not a health expert. Angelina Jolie is not a health expert,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>All in all, Hoffman said, public health officials could work with celebrities to harness their fame to spread evidence-based health information and mitigate the spread of misinformation.</p>\n<p>He cited supermodel Christy Turlington Burns as a positive example of a celebrity working with public health authorities to promote positive health practices.

Just look at what happened after Charlie Sheen's HIV disclosure two years ago, said John Ayers , a research professor at San Diego State University. Sales of in-home HIV testing kits reached record highs around the same time the actor announced that he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2015, according to a study published in the journal Prevention Science on Thursday. Ayers was a co-author of the study. About the same time, \"in record numbers, people were going online, seeking out information on what the signs of HIV are, on how to find and appropriately prevent HIV with devices such as condoms and also how to get tested,'\" Ayers said. \"We've seen this ... many times over.\" For the new study, Ayers and his co-authors monitored weekly sales of OraQuick, the only FDA-approved at-home oral HIV testing kit available in the United States, from 2014 to 2016. The researchers found that there were 8,225 more sales than they expected the week of Sheen's HIV status announcement. Elevated sales continued for four weeks after Sheen's disclosure. The findings show a correlation, not a direct causation. Yet in a previous study, Ayers and his colleagues also found that Google searches for HIV testing and related topics also spiked after Sheen's announcement. \"The most common reaction is, 'So what? What does a search really mean?' Our new study shows not only did Sheen's disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention, it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales,\" Ayers said. Though they are not doctors, many celebrities have had both positive and negative ties to public health in recent years. When celebrities open up about their health \"The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV,\" said Steven Hoffman, scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab.

A team of researchers, led by San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health associate research professor John W. Ayers, reached this conclusion by going back and monitoring over 12 years of Google searches regarding buying marijuana -- from January 2005 and June 2017. Searches included many terms for cannabis; including marijuana, weed, and pot, which the researchers combined with the terms like buy, shop, or order. Furthermore, the biggest finding of the study shows that online \"marijuana buying\" searches have practically tripled between 2005 to 2017 in the U.S., reaching a peak of between 1.4 and 2.4 million searches each month.

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement. Still, in the wake of the nation's recent spate of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping, a similarly unregulated product, Ayers thinks CBD's online popularity should serve as a call to action for regulators. \"We already saw what can happen with vaping,\" he said. \"Imagine with the demand for CBD, if we have a tainted product out there.\"", "description": "Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked between 2014 and 2019.", "publication": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514", "original_url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514"}

Mike Segar/Reuters </figcaption></figure>\n<p>When Charlie Sheen <a href=\"https://www.today.com/health/charlie-sheen-reveals-hes-hiv-positive-today-show-exclusive-t56391\">went on the <em>Today </em>show</a> to disclose his HIV-positive status in November 2015, he told Matt Lauer, &quot;I release myself from this prison today,&quot; one he described as full of secrecy and extortion.</p>\n<p>This past January, he recounted the day he was diagnosed, about four years before he went public. &quot;I immediately wanted to eat a bullet,&quot; <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/charlie-sheen-opens-battle-hiv-feel-carrying-torch/story?id=44641951\">he told Michael Strahan on <em>Good Morning America</em></a>. &quot;But then, something else came over me. They gave me a handful of pills and said, 'You can go home now, and you're going to live,'&quot; he said. &quot;I feel like I'm carrying the torch for a lot of folks out there that are suffering from the same thing.&quot;</p>\n<p>Though he may have had other reasons initially for revealing his diagnosis to the world, researchers believe his decision helped spur people to seek information about and get tested for HIV, with Sheen inadvertently playing a role he later took on more consciously.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2495274\"> research letter</a> published in <em> JAMA Internal Medicine</em> in February 2016 found that media reports and internet searches related to HIV <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/new-study-shows-charlie-sheens-recent-disclosure-may-have-helped-raise-hiv-429270\"> spiked over the course of a day after Sheen's disclosure</a>. A follow-up study published Thursday in the journal <em> Prevention Science</em> now shows that sales of rapid at-home test kits also increased drastically after Sheen's disclosure and that web search trends can serve as strong predictors of sales.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/new-study-shows-charlie-sheens-recent-disclosure-may-have-helped-raise-hiv-429270\"><strong>Related: New study shows Charlie Sheen's recent disclosure may have helped raise HIV awareness</strong></a></p>\n<p>At the time of his announcement, &quot;Charlie Sheen himself didn't talk about HIV prevention. Matt Lauer didn't talk about HIV prevention. Instead, the focus of that interview and the focus of other interviews and other reporting was largely on Charlie Sheen himself, mostly his sex life,&quot; says John W. Ayers, a professor at the San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health who led the research team. But &quot;for 20 years, there's been a consistent message when it comes to HIV prevention, that is know the signs, get tested, always use condoms,&quot; he says. It made him wonder whether the disclosure could &quot;nudge people into engaging with HIV prevention.&quot;</p>\n<p>About 1.2 million people in the U.S. are HIV-positive, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html\"> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, but one in eight of those doesn't know it yet. That translates to more than 150,000 individuals who are not aware of their infection. &quot;Untested individuals are responsible for most new infections,&quot; the researchers write. &quot;As a result, testing is the most cost-effective HIV prevention strategy and must be accelerated when opportunities are presented.&quot;</p>\n<p>The new study, titled &quot;The Charlie Sheen Effect on Rapid In-Home Human Immunodeficiency Virus Test Sales,&quot; looked at weekly sales of OraQuick, which the researchers say is the only rapid in-home HIV test kit available in the U.S., including both brick-and-mortar and online purchases. Data provided to Ayers and his team by OraSure, which makes the OraQuick test, showed that sales increased 95 percent the week of Sheen's disclosure and remained higher than anticipated (based on an algorithm used to forecast sales) for another four weeks. Whereas a typical week might see sales at roughly 3,500, the number jumped to more than 7,000 the week of the disclosure. In total, the company had 8,225 more sales than anticipated in the period following Sheen's <em>Today</em> interview. The effect is equivalent to that of more than seven World AIDS Days, the researchers write, which saw only 1,122 more sales than expected in 2014. The researchers also found that they could use web search trends to predict sales within 7 percent of the actual tally.</p>\n<p>Ayers describes the reaction from public health investigators to his team's first study as laced with skepticism. That community is used to dealing with data like test sales, he says. His team, therefore, wanted to &quot;wed novel data to more traditional data.&quot; They achieved their goal by showing that novel data, like web search trends, could very closely predict traditional data, like sales. Since web search trends are available much faster, it could help public health experts and advocacy organizations respond more effectively to opportunities like Sheen's disclosure.</p>\n<p>&quot;We can rapidly know what people are thinking and when. What they're searching provides insight into real-world behaviors,&quot; Ayers says. &quot;Imagine, if you will, had HIV leaders, had the media fostered HIV prevention methods, how much larger those effects could have been,&quot; he adds. &quot;Even now, we could probably act on this.&quot;</p>\n<p>Jesse Milan Jr., president and CEO of AIDS United, echoes Ayers. AIDS United, a nonprofit whose mission is to end the AIDS epidemic in the U.S., and organizations like it, &quot;can use this data to improve the work that we're doing,&quot; Milan says. &quot;These studies really do reinforce how important it is for all of us working in HIV to use technology to our advantage, to use social media to our advantage and to help the consumer population to use them to their advantage.&quot;</p>\n<p>For AIDS United, studies like the ones led by Ayers are particularly helpful in work they're doing as part of a cooperative agreement with the CDC, focusing heavily on leveraging social media in HIV prevention efforts. &quot;This is data that guides us on what the population who needs those messages are doing and thinking,&quot; Milan says.</p>\n<p>&quot;We hear over and over again how the stigma of having HIV prevents people from wanting to know their HIV status,&quot; he says. He emphasizes that every disclosure, whether it's one-on-one to a family member or publicly on television, helps encourage people living at risk to get tested.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think Charlie Sheen is right up there with Betty Ford about her addiction,&quot; he says. &quot;The stigma is only broken down when people break their silence.&quot;</p>", "outline_img": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=newsweek.com", "archived_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210616210445/https://www.newsweek.com/charlie-sheens-hiv-disclosure-inspired-record-numbers-americans-get-tested-611756", "headline": "", "article": "", "description": null, "publication": null, "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/charlie-sheens-hiv-disclosure-inspired-record-numbers-americans-get-tested-611756", "original_url": "https://www.newsweek.com/charlie-sheens-hiv-disclosure-inspired-record-numbers-americans-get-tested-611756"}

The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for HIV is \"a good thing, regardless of who he is.\" Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this article.

This type of hit is not achieved by most e-cigarette and vaping devices.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why do you think heat-not-burn cigarettes have the potential to be popular in the U.S.?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Heat-not-burn products are taking off in markets they've been introduced into around the world [and] there is also clearly a demand for &quot;safer&quot; tobacco products in the United States. This has been seen mainly in the major growth in e-cigarette use over the last 5 years, but is also seen even among cigarette brands. For instance, in a recent <a href=\"https://goo.gl/AbdSqe\">report</a> we showed that more than 2.5 million U.S. smokers use a brand of cigarettes that they believe might be &quot;less harmful.&quot;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>The FDA's <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm568923.htm\">new plan</a> for tobacco and nicotine regulation aims to reduce nicotine in combustible cigarettes, while giving newly regulated combustible and non-combustible tobacco products extended deadlines to apply for review. How might this affect the review process for heat-not-burn cigarettes? </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>It's too early for me to know what impact, if any, that new plan will have on heat-not-burn products. What I do know is that PMI [Phillip Morris International] is going through the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/TobaccoProductReviewEvaluation/ucm304465.htm\">modified risk tobacco product</a>&quot; permitting process, which is different than the premarket process for other tobacco products. In this process, the manufacturer attempts to provide evidence that their product has reduced health risks compared to similar types of tobacco products on the market. Upon completion the manufacturer can make claims of reduce-harm in their marketing.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>In your paper, you and your co-authors recommend &quot;traditional surveillance strategies&quot; to monitor heat-not-burn markets. What would this would entail? </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Adding questions about heat-not-burn cigarettes to surveys to understand use and perceptions of these products among the general population. For instance, these items could be added to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [a nationwide health-related telephone survey system that collects data from U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and use of preventive service] which is run by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Your team's <a href=\"https://id.elsevier.com/ACW/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com%2Faction%2FconsumeSsoCookie%3FredirectUri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ajpmonline.org%252Faction%252FconsumeSharedSessionAction%253FJSESSIONID%253Daaafg9fVkS9-A8zV3qE8v%2526MAID%253DmtXTDmS%25252FqWP8Ch5BKIaWpQ%25253D%25253D%2526SERVER%253DWZ6myaEXBLGZpQFlLdJmhw%25253D%25253D%2526ORIGIN%253D29944533%2526RD%253DRD\">previous \u200bstudies</a> of e-cigarettes first\u200b\u200b \u200bpredicted\u200b \u200bthe\u200b \u200brise\u200b \u200bof\u200b \u200bactual\u200b \u200bvaping\u200b \u200brates.

It was published in the medical journal of Prevention Science Friday, ABC news report said. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" Eric Leas, a research associate at the San Diego State Universitys doctoral program in public health said in a statement Friday. The analysts narrowed down their research to weekly analysis from April 12, 2016, to April 16, 2016, and took OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests as their sample. Since OraQuick was the only test of this kind available in the U.S., it became much easier for the research. After conducting the research, analysts found out that the week after Sheen announced his HIV status, there was a 95% spike in OraQuick HIV test sales. After the successful completion of this small research project, analysts continued to track sales figures which were constantly above normal for the next four weeks, the ABC report said. And if that wasnt all, researchers found the sales figures exceeded the ones after World Aids Day. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people. But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest,\" Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor at NYU Langone Medical Center, said. \"Just like everybody, I watched on the Today Show when Sheen disclosed his HIV status, but when I watched it as a public health advocate, I saw that neither Sheen nor [Matt] Lauer was talking about HIV prevention,\" Dr. John Ayers, a scientist at the SDSU told Global news. \"The headlines after that said little about HIV prevention, and I thought, 'Thats sad, because wouldnt it be great to get the positive message out there? The message has been consistent: know the signs and get tested,\" he added. Turns out the news of his HIV status itself was enough to increase HIV awareness among Americans.", "description": "A study conducted by San Diego State University (SDSU) researchers last year showed Sheens revelation of his HIV status urged millions of people to undergo HIV tests.", "publication": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/charlie-sheens-hiv-disclosure-almost-doubled-sales-test-kits-study-reveals-2541089", "original_url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/charlie-sheens-hiv-disclosure-almost-doubled-sales-test-kits-study-reveals-2541089"}

Extrapolating from that data, they used an algorithm to estimate how many times Americans would have searched the terms \"sexual\" with \"harassment\" and \"sexual\" with \"assault\" between Oct. 15, 2017, and June 15, 2018, if the #MeToo movement had never happened.

Splash News TMZ caught up with the actor, and while he seemed to be well aware of the statistics, he didn't say he was the sole catalyst for the sales, saying instead that it was likely \"a confluence of a lot of different elements.\" \"I think people just saw what happened to me and said, 'I better take a little bit of precaution,'\" he said. \"It's exciting and it's great to be of service of that level because if you can take the steps to find out, then you're protecting yourself as well as others.\" Since he came out with the positive diagnosis, Charlie said his life has been \"elevated in a lot of ways.\" \"I've been called to a higher order,\" he said. \"I've been -- I don't want to say tasked -- but in some ways, yeah, in other ways gifted with an opportunity to help a lot of people. And that's what I'm doing.\"", "description": "Charlie Sheen is being credited with the boost in the sales of HIV test kits.", "publication": "Wonderwall.com", "url": "https://www.wonderwall.com/news/charlie-sheen-say-hes-been-called-higher-order-after-sheen-effect-study-3006720.article", "original_url": "https://www.wonderwall.com/news/charlie-sheen-say-hes-been-called-higher-order-after-sheen-effect-study-3006720.article"}

Most of these were small &mdash; with fewer than 40 people each &mdash; and ran for only 4 to 5 weeks.</p>\n<p>Researchers did find that pharmaceutical THC &mdash; with or without CBD &mdash; reduced symptoms of anxiety in people with other medical conditions, compared to a nonactive placebo.</p>\n<p>However, Dr. Roopali Parikh, MD, a psychiatrist specializing in substance use disorder at <a href=\"https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/psychiatry/dr-roopali-bipin-parikh-md-11381878\">Northwell Health Physician Partners&rsquo; Behavioral Health Group Practice</a> in Manhasset, New York, pointed out that this evidence was of &ldquo;low quality&rdquo; and based on only seven studies with a total of 252 patients.</p>\n<p>There was no impact of pharmaceutical THC &mdash; with or without CBD &mdash; on depression symptoms.</p>\n<p>Most of the studies for anxiety and depression were for conditions like chronic, noncancer pain and multiple sclerosis, with anxiety or depression as a secondary symptom.</p>\n<p>THC is the compound in cannabis that causes the &ldquo;high,&rdquo; while CBD is nonintoxicating. Cannabis and some cannabis products contain both of these compounds in differing amounts. CBD oil is also available with no or very low amounts of THC.</p>\n<p>The reduction in anxiety symptoms seen in some studies may have been because the pharmaceutical THC relieved the symptoms of the main medical condition, write the authors in the paper.</p>\n<p>As for PTSD, ADHD, psychosis, and Tourette syndrome, the researchers found no evidence that any type of cannabinoid improved the symptoms.</p>\n<p>In fact, one study suggests that pharmaceutical THC made the symptoms of psychosis worse.</p>\n<p>In addition, pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) was linked to a twofold increase in adverse events, said Parikh, who wasn&rsquo;t involved in the study.

What We Know", "article": "Share on Pinterest Researchers are learning how cannabis compounds affect people. Getty Images Theres not enough scientific evidence to recommend cannabinoids for treating mental health conditions, a new study finds. Products with THC or CBD have been used in recent years as a way to self-medicate for certain mental health conditions. Experts say people pursuing these options need to be careful and talk with their physician. Consumer interest in using cannabis -- especially cannabidiol, or CBD -- to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions has increased sharply in the past few years. This trend is driven in part by celebrities like Jennifer Aniston and Kristen Bell who are embracing CBD as a way to ease their symptoms of anxiety and depression. But the buzz around the mental health benefits of cannabinoids -- which includes cannabis and compounds like CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC -- has far outpaced the science, suggests a major new study . Researchers found that theres \"inadequate evidence\" available to suggest that cannabinoids can improve the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. \"Based on this evidence, physicians should refrain from recommending cannabinoids to their patients for the treatment of mental health disorders,\" said Dr. Elina Drits, associate chair of psychiatry at Staten Island University Hospital in Staten Island, New York. Little evidence of THC and CBD for mental illness The researchers analysis included 83 studies from 1980 through 2018 that looked at the use of cannabinoids to treat symptoms of mental health conditions. This included studies looking at the treatment of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), psychosis, and Tourette syndrome. Only 40 studies were randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for medical evidence. Most of these were small -- with fewer than 40 people each -- and ran for only 4 to 5 weeks. Researchers did find that pharmaceutical THC -- with or without CBD -- reduced symptoms of anxiety in people with other medical conditions, compared to a nonactive placebo. However, Dr. Roopali Parikh, MD, a psychiatrist specializing in substance use disorder at Northwell Health Physician Partners Behavioral Health Group Practice in Manhasset, New York, pointed out that this evidence was of \"low quality\" and based on only seven studies with a total of 252 patients. There was no impact of pharmaceutical THC -- with or without CBD -- on depression symptoms. Most of the studies for anxiety and depression were for conditions like chronic, noncancer pain and multiple sclerosis, with anxiety or depression as a secondary symptom. THC is the compound in cannabis that causes the \"high,\" while CBD is nonintoxicating. Cannabis and some cannabis products contain both of these compounds in differing amounts. CBD oil is also available with no or very low amounts of THC. The reduction in anxiety symptoms seen in some studies may have been because the pharmaceutical THC relieved the symptoms of the main medical condition, write the authors in the paper. As for PTSD, ADHD, psychosis, and Tourette syndrome, the researchers found no evidence that any type of cannabinoid improved the symptoms. In fact, one study suggests that pharmaceutical THC made the symptoms of psychosis worse. In addition, pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) was linked to a twofold increase in adverse events, said Parikh, who wasnt involved in the study. There was also an almost threefold increase in people dropping out of the studies due to negative side effects, she said. Other research has shown that theres a significant risk of negative side effects from cannabinoid use -- not just addiction, but also depression, anxiety, and psychosis.", "description": "Researchers found that theres \"inadequate evidence\" available to suggest that cannabinoids can improve the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.", "publication": "Healthline", "url": "https://www.healthline.com/health-news/does-cbd-help-your-mental-health-heres-what-we-know", "original_url": "https://www.healthline.com/health-news/does-cbd-help-your-mental-health-heres-what-we-know"}

Unlike many other attempts at such therapies, the focus will be to ensure that the treatments are affordable and available to resource-poor countries, especially in Africa. The move comes amid growing concern that new treatments that alter the underlying genetics of a disease will be prohibitively expensive -- a gene therapy for a rare form of blindness, for instance, costs around $425,000 per eye. The initiative will aim to test any potential cures in the U.S. and countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the next seven to 10 years, and to then make such therapies available in the hardest-hit areas. \"We aim to go big or go home,\" NIH Director Francis Collins said in a statement. FDA wants stronger warning on breast implants about risks The FDA wants women getting breast implants to receive stronger warnings and more details about the risks and complications associated with the procedure. The agency issued a draft guidance document calling on breast implant makers to include a boxed warning as well as a checklist that patients can use to better understand the risks, including pain and scarring. The FDA is also recommending that labels include information about whats in the implants. The new guidance comes after reports in recent months linking certain kinds of implants with illnesses in women with the products.

Inside STAT: A toxic weed fuels a cancer-drug gold rush -- and a quandary The drug was still experimental, but already it was something of a celebrity. For patients with Gorlin syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, the idea that a gel might reduce the skin cancer surgeries they needed was so seductive it hardly seemed real. In fact, it nearly hadnt been. The medicine had come from an unlikely place -- the wild cow cabbage patches around Manti-La Sal National Forest -- on an even unlikelier assumption: that this botanical Gold Rush would yield a treatment for a whole litany of cancers. In the second half of \"The Medicine Hunters,\" STATs Eric Boodman brings you inside both that drug-finding quest -- involving machetes, mowers, and some of the biggest pharma companies in the world -- as well as the quest of Gorlin patients to reduce these medications' financial toxicity. Read the story here. Google searches for CBD have skyrocketed in recent years CBD products are widely advertised as a treatment for a plethora of ailments, and a new study finds that Google searches for such items have also skyrocketed recently. Looking at data between January 2004 and April 2019, scientists found that although searches for CBD products were relatively stable during the first decade of the study period, they increased by 126% in 2017 compared to 2016, and 160% in 2018 compared to the previous year. There were more than 6 million searches last April, which outnumbered searches for other health terms including acupuncture and meditation. At the same time, a new report outlines the global use of different drugs -- including cannabis -- and finds that in Canada and some U.S. states, CBD products are used to treat medical conditions \"in the absence of evidence of their effectiveness and safety.\" A new test could identify tuberculosis in less than an hour Tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease globally, but quickly detecting it -- and distinguishing it from other respiratory infections with similar symptoms -- has remained a challenge. A new paper describes a test capable of diagnosing TB in less than an hour. Using machine learning techniques to sift through data from 317 patients, the scientists identified four blood proteins that are unique to tuberculosis to develop their test. The accuracy of the test improved when they added a fifth marker that picked up on specific proteins produced in response to toxins expressed by TB. Overall, the new test was correctly able to identify those with TB 86% of the time, and was correctly able to rule out disease in non-TB infected people 69% of the time, which aligns with the WHOs requirements for a new TB test. Nature journals gets a new look The scientific journal Nature and many of its affiliate journals -- where your Morning Rounds writer previously worked -- are getting a makeover. Specifically, many of the Nature journals now have a new \"digital friendly\" font and logo. This isnt the first time for such an update: In an article, Kelly Krause, one of Natures creative directors, explains that ornate Victorian embellishments graced the journal when it was founded in 1869, while it opted for a more minimalistic look in the 1960s. For the newest change, the team took into account how science often uses standalone letters to represent concepts -- such as a -- and how the new typeface needed to account for people accessing materials on smaller, mobile devices. The team ultimately settled on a typeface theyre calling Harding -- named for the late neurologist Anita Harding. What to read around the web today Is the stethoscope dying?

It's not your imagination, cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, has seemingly infiltrated every consumer product -- from skin care to gummy candies to vape pens to dog treats. Now there's data to back up that trend, according to a study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Wednesday. Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked 126% between 2016 and 2018, and 160% between 2017 and 2018, according to the study. Those searches are expected to be up another 118% this year, with 6.4 million CBD Google searches logged in April alone, the most current month for which data is available. In addition, the new study is a window into a nationwide phenomenon that's stretched beyond the wellness set or big cities. The biggest year-over-year spike in searches wasn't in New York or California, but rather, in Alabama, which saw searches grow more than 600% between 2018 and 2019. Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement. Still, in the wake of the nation's recent spate of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping, a similarly unregulated product, Ayers thinks CBD's online popularity should serve as a call to action for regulators. \"We already saw what can happen with vaping,\" he said. \"Imagine with the demand for CBD, if we have a tainted product out there.\"", "description": "Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked between 2014 and 2019.", "publication": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514", "original_url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514"}

Presently aged 51, he has on many occasions made headlines with his controversial remarks and behavior. He recently cited borderline dementia brought about by his &quot;old&quot; HIV medication as one of the main causes for his erratic behavior. The following was his statement in relation to this while speaking to a crowd of 300 people at Hollywood Roosevelt.</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;[The drugs] kept me suppressed and alive, but I struggled with a constant migraine and at times, borderline dementia. I've started to feel back to myself again and back in touch with all aspects of my life. When I was first diagnosed, I knew it wasn't a death sentence but it was just a giant frickin' bummer. I accept the gift of being alive. I could run and hide from this whole thing and not be outspoken and honest and open about it, but I've chosen a path that's the opposite.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>His activities and speeches as pertaining to HIV awareness are said to have contributed to a significant increase in the use of HIV testing kits. In 2015, when he revealed to the world that he was HIV-positive, researchers apparently observed that there was a significant increase in the use of HIV home test kits and related online searches. The following is an excerpt of the report on this by the <em>Inquirer</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;What's striking is that Sheen's public disclosure increased sales of HIV home-testing kit OraQuick almost eight times more than after long-running awareness campaign World AIDS Day, which has been held every December 1 since 1988.&quot;<p>&quot;San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health research professor John W. Ayers headed the research that analyzed Google search data, which found that there were millions of searches on HIV prevention and testing after Sheen discussed his illness. Notable was that there was no call on HIV awareness at that time from either Sheen or public health leaders. The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ayers and his team then analyzed search queries and sales of home-testing kit OraQuick within the United States. They found that there was a correlation between the online searches on HIV and testing to the number of home-testing kits purchased. OraQuick is an oral swab test and is the &quot;only rapid in-home HIV test kit available in the United States,'&quot;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Charlie Sheen was, however, recently reported to be broke. The actor once commanded $1.8 million an episode. However, his spending habits and the millions he apparently paid out to people close to him to keep quiet about his HIV diagnosis was apparently too much. In September last year, <em>Radar</em> reported that the actor had moved into his parents' home in Malibu. This is according to a source who spoke to the site.

Presently aged 51, he has on many occasions made headlines with his controversial remarks and behavior. He recently cited borderline dementia brought about by his \"old\" HIV medication as one of the main causes for his erratic behavior. The following was his statement in relation to this while speaking to a crowd of 300 people at Hollywood Roosevelt. \"[The drugs] kept me suppressed and alive, but I struggled with a constant migraine and at times, borderline dementia. I've started to feel back to myself again and back in touch with all aspects of my life. When I was first diagnosed, I knew it wasn't a death sentence but it was just a giant frickin' bummer. I accept the gift of being alive. I could run and hide from this whole thing and not be outspoken and honest and open about it, but I've chosen a path that's the opposite.\" \"What's striking is that Sheen's public disclosure increased sales of HIV home-testing kit OraQuick almost eight times more than after long-running awareness campaign World AIDS Day, which has been held every December 1 since 1988.\" \"San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health research professor John W. Ayers headed the research that analyzed Google search data, which found that there were millions of searches on HIV prevention and testing after Sheen discussed his illness. Notable was that there was no call on HIV awareness at that time from either Sheen or public health leaders. The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine.\" \"Ayers and his team then analyzed search queries and sales of home-testing kit OraQuick within the United States. They found that there was a correlation between the online searches on HIV and testing to the number of home-testing kits purchased. OraQuick is an oral swab test and is the \"only rapid in-home HIV test kit available in the United States,'\" my favorite Robin yet (c)[?] pic.twitter.com/KMuTaID1Iq -- Charlie Sheen (@charliesheen) May 9, 2017 \"It's sad.

In 2015, when he revealed to the world that he was HIV-positive, researchers apparently observed that there was a significant increase in the use of HIV home test kits and related online searches. The following is an excerpt of the report on this by the Inquirer.Charlie Sheen was, however, recently reported to be broke. The actor once commanded $1.8 million an episode. However, his spending habits and the millions he apparently paid out to people close to him to keep quiet about his HIV diagnosis was apparently too much. In September last year, Radar reported that the actor had moved into his parents' home in Malibu. This is according to a source who spoke to the site. This is what he revealed about the actor.In a most recent report by the site, the Anger Management actor is also paid to make appearances. This is also according to an insider.

It should be motivation to conduct <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/study-on-the-treatment-of-mental-health-conditions-using-medical-cannabis/\">more rigorous studies</a>, especially given the rise in use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products specifically for mental health, and the large swaths of the public deciding on their own that cannabis <em>does</em> treat these symptoms.</p>\n<p>People are widely using cannabis&mdash;both THC and CBD&mdash;for their mental health. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395917300130?via%3Dihub\">a study</a> found that people perceive cannabis to be an effective way to treat many conditions, and that some substituted cannabis for prescription medications like benzodiazepines (often given for anxiety) or antidepressants. In a 2018 study of <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2018.0006\">over 2,400 CBD users</a>, 62 percent said they used CBD for a medical condition&mdash;the top three being pain, anxiety, and depression.</p>\n<p>Just because your friend or your favorite Instagram influencer took CBD and it improved their anxiety better isn&rsquo;t enough to determine whether cannabis is effective for that purpose. This kind of evidence is called <em>anecdotal</em> and it can feel immensely powerful, especially if the experience happened to you. But that&rsquo;s not the way we decide that treatments are safe and effective. Even results from single studies might not be enough, especially when it comes to difficult areas like mental health. Consider the fact that researchers <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325767.php\">are still</a> <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e024886.full\">having debates</a> about whether or not SSRIs are more effective than placebos for depression&mdash; and those medications have been around for decades <em>and</em> have no issues surrounding legality that result in limits on research. This is one of the reasons scientists write reviews and meta-analyses, to try and combine findings from many studies.</p>\n<p>The authors of the new review searched for studies published between 1980 and 2018, including unpublished or ongoing studies, where medicinal cannabinoids were given to adults to treat depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. In the end, they included 83 studies, 30 of which were randomized controlled trials&mdash;considered the gold standard of study design.</p>\n<p>The results were mixed. &quot;Our analyses and conclusions are limited by the small amount of available data, small study sizes, and heterogeneity of findings across studies,&quot; the authors wrote.</p>\n<p>They found that pharmaceutical-grade THC made anxiety symptoms better, but only in people who had other medical conditions like chronic pain. This is an important caveat. If, for example, the primary outcome of a study was seeing if cannabis could help with chronic pain and a person&rsquo;s depression also improved, it&rsquo;s hard to say whether the cannabis treated the depression, or if their pain got better and made them feel less depressed.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/videos/5a/28/5a2871ae177dd46a436f1f25/5a2871ae177dd46a436f1f25-1512684719641.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center\"></img></figure>\n<p>In one study the review looked at, pharmaceutical cannabis made psychotic symptoms <em>worse</em>, while in others, pharmaceutical cannabis didn&rsquo;t show any significant effect on mental disorders, but was linked to increased side effects.

CBD, a chemical found in the cannabis plant, is having its moment, after being seized on by the wellness empire for its rumored ability to help with a whole host of conditions, from anxiety to insomnia to depression. The CBD industry is estimated to grow to almost $2 billion by 2022, and cannabis use overall has increased 43 percent between 2007 and 2015; it's now medicinally legal in 33 states. But despite how ubiquitous CBD lattes may be, they are not matched by an equal amount of research on their benefits for the mind. Advertisement A new review and meta-analysis published this week in The Lancet Psychiatry looked for the effects of cannabinoids on mental health in nearly 40 years of research and their findings sounded grim: They wrote there was \"scarce evidence\" to support that cannabis improves mental health symptoms, leading publications like The Guardian to publish an article titled \"Risks of cannabis use for mental health treatment outweigh benefits,\" and write that \"the use of cannabis medicines to treat people with depression, anxiety, psychosis or other mental health issues cannot be justified because there is little evidence that they work or are safe.\" Time similarly concluded that \"There's 'Scarce Evidence' That Cannabis Helps Mental Health Issues.\" This review reveals something many clinicians already knew: We dont have enough evidence to say that cannabis can treat mental health disorders. That doesnt necessarily mean weed doesnt help at all--it means we just don't know. (And since risks of long-term cannabis use have been well-documented, of course they would outweigh benefits we are unaware of.) \"The old adage that absence of evidence doesnt necessarily mean absence of effectiveness is true here,\" said Harry Sumnall, a professor of substance use at Liverpool John Moores Public Health Institute in the U.K., who was not involved in the review. Finding a lack of evidence isn't a reason to throw in the towel. It should be motivation to conduct more rigorous studies, especially given the rise in use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products specifically for mental health, and the large swaths of the public deciding on their own that cannabis does treat these symptoms. Advertisement People are widely using cannabis--both THC and CBD--for their mental health. In 2017, a study found that people perceive cannabis to be an effective way to treat many conditions, and that some substituted cannabis for prescription medications like benzodiazepines (often given for anxiety) or antidepressants. In a 2018 study of over 2,400 CBD users, 62 percent said they used CBD for a medical condition--the top three being pain, anxiety, and depression. Just because your friend or your favorite Instagram influencer took CBD and it improved their anxiety better isnt enough to determine whether cannabis is effective for that purpose. This kind of evidence is called anecdotal and it can feel immensely powerful, especially if the experience happened to you. But thats not the way we decide that treatments are safe and effective. Even results from single studies might not be enough, especially when it comes to difficult areas like mental health. Consider the fact that researchers are still having debates about whether or not SSRIs are more effective than placebos for depression-- and those medications have been around for decades and have no issues surrounding legality that result in limits on research. This is one of the reasons scientists write reviews and meta-analyses, to try and combine findings from many studies. The authors of the new review searched for studies published between 1980 and 2018, including unpublished or ongoing studies, where medicinal cannabinoids were given to adults to treat depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. In the end, they included 83 studies, 30 of which were randomized controlled trials--considered the gold standard of study design. Advertisement The results were mixed. \"Our analyses and conclusions are limited by the small amount of available data, small study sizes, and heterogeneity of findings across studies,\" the authors wrote. They found that pharmaceutical-grade THC made anxiety symptoms better, but only in people who had other medical conditions like chronic pain. This is an important caveat. If, for example, the primary outcome of a study was seeing if cannabis could help with chronic pain and a persons depression also improved, its hard to say whether the cannabis treated the depression, or if their pain got better and made them feel less depressed. In one study the review looked at, pharmaceutical cannabis made psychotic symptoms worse, while in others, pharmaceutical cannabis didnt show any significant effect on mental disorders, but was linked to increased side effects. The authors noted that there were very few randomized controlled trials for them to review that tested pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis. Another issue is that many people don't take pharmaceutical or medicinal cannabis, they buy it recreationally--the studies can't account for that variability either. \"To make more confident conclusions we need more evidence; but at the moment there is not a lot that can support, guide or inform use of cannabinoids for mental disorders,\" said Louisa Degenhardt, the deputy director at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at The University of New South Wales in Sydney, and senior author on the review.

Asi se desprende de los resultados de un estudio publicado en la revista 'Prevention Science', que se suma a los de un trabajo publicado hace un ano en otra revista cientifica que ya vinculo dicho anuncio a un aumento de las consultas en Internet relacionadas con la prevencion y el diagnostico del VIH, a pesar de que ni Sheen ni las autoridades sanitarias aprovecharon la ocasion para lanzar un mensaje de salud publica. En este caso, los investigadores recopilaron datos de las ventas semanales del kit de diagnostico 'OraQuick', el unico que se comercializa en Estados Unidos para su uso domestico, y tambien analizaron las busquedas en Google de este producto para relacionar ambos factores con la entrevista del actor en la cadena de television NBC en la que confeso su enfermedad. \"Una estrategia que nos permitio obtener una estimacion real del 'efecto Charlie Sheen' sobre la prevencion del VIH\", ha explicado Eric Leas, uno de los investigadores de este trabajo.

Nationwide, searches for CBD outstripped queries for other popular health topics, like veganism, vaccination and marijuana. \"We think of dieting as being the most popular health search term ever, and for every two searches for dieting, there's one for CBD,\" said John Ayers, co-author of the study and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"What you search for predicts what you buy,\" he added. Clearly there's a demand for information, but details about the product itself is frustratingly limited. CBD, which is derived from cannabis plants, isn't psychoactive, meaning unlike the other well-known ingredient in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it doesn't get you high. While CBD has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating epilepsy, beyond that that limited use, it has no proven health benefits. That hasn't stopped brands from marketing their CBD products with claims promising to aid sleep, sooth anxiety, relieve menstrual cramps, help with headaches, treat acne and cure opioid addiction, among other benefits. \"When people are allowed to market CBD by saying anything, is it surprising that demand for it is so high?\" Ayers asked. In response to rampant misinformation over unapproved cures, the FDA sent at least six warning letters this year to firms improperly marketing CBD products, which the agency says \"are not approved by FDA for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.\" Under current FDA rules, CBD cannot be added to food or drink, nor marketed as a dietary supplement. Still, in the wake of the nation's recent spate of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping, a similarly unregulated product, Ayers thinks CBD's online popularity should serve as a call to action for regulators. \"We already saw what can happen with vaping,\" he said. \"Imagine with the demand for CBD, if we have a tainted product out there.\"", "description": "Following a decade of stable Google searches for CBD, or cannabidiol, the number of searches for those terms spiked between 2014 and 2019.", "publication": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514", "original_url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/google-searches-cbd-expected-hit-record-high-year/story?id=66448514"}

Human immunodeficiency virus infection can lead to AIDS, which affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sheen's announcement, which made national headlines, renewed attention to the dangers of HIV and AIDS at the time. According to the study update, what it called the \"Charlie Sheen effect\" had a big impact on HIV testing in the U.S., with sales of at-home testing nearly doubling the week of his announcement. Researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California at San Diego, among other institutions, published their findings today in the medical journal Prevention Science. The study was a follow-up to one published last year, which documented a surge in people searching for information on HIV and AIDS. \"Our strategy allowed us to provide a real-world estimation of the Charlie Sheen effect on HIV prevention and contrast that effect with our past formative assessment using Internet searches,\" study co-author Eric Leas, a research associate in the San Diego State University-UCSD doctoral program in public health, said in statement today. The researchers looked at weekly sales data from April 12, 2014, to April 16, 2016, of OraQuick rapid in-home HIV tests, the only test of this type available in the U.S. They found that the week after Sheen announced on the \"Today\" show that he was HIV positive, in November 2015, there was a 95 percent increase in OraQuick HIV test sales. The HIV test sales continued to be above normal over the next four weeks, fluctuating from approximately 20 percent to 60 percent above the previous level. Surprisingly, researchers found that these numbers far surpassed the sales uptick after World AIDS Day. Despite widespread attention to encourage people to get tested or be HIV aware through the World AIDS Day campaign, they found that sales increased just 31 percent but that rates returned to normal the next week. Testing is key to combating HIV, since symptoms of infection often do not appear for years. According to the CDC, 1 in 8 of those infected in the U.S. is not aware of having the virus. John Ayers, a behavioral scientist at SDSU, said the study could help public health officials better engage with people. \"We can make public health more connected to the public it serves,\" he told ABC News. According to him, the public health system is top-down, and informational messages come mainly from experts. \"We forgot to listen to the public, and this is what the public is engaging on.\" Ayers and his team also looked at how search terms on Google trends were associated with increased sales and found they could predict sales within a somewhat small margin of error. \"We can discover when events are occurring, measure their impact and work to grow their impact,\" he said. \"That's what public health can become.\" The case shows it is key for public health officials to take advantage of these public announcements, according to Dr. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"People look down at celebrities and feel that the information that's being generated is not useful to regular people,\" Lerner said. \"But it reminds us that, regardless of who the person is, it will at least generate interest.\" Ayers had a similar take. \"It's an empowering message. The truth is that you can make a difference by just speaking out on something,\" he said. \"We all hear talk is cheap. That's not true.\" Lerner said that Sheen's talking about his high-risk sexual practices may have also helped educate people about risks surrounding HIV, which is primarily spread through sexual contact and intravenous drug use. Additionally, Lerner said, more people getting tested for HIV is \"a good thing, regardless of who he is.\" Dr. Crystal Tan contributed to this article.

With increasing user engagement, the opportunity to help those in need could be lifesaving, as there were over 47,000 deaths from opiate overdose in 2017. And because of the stigmatized nature of those with substance use disorder, the use of an IVA could confidentially direct people in need to the precious resources they need.</p>\n<p>The only issue is that public health researchers have yet to study if these new technologies can truly help people in need. As a result, we don't have enough data regarding how useful or harmful they could be to the general public.</p>\n<p>As background, one prior <a data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2500043\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2500043\">study</a> indicated that smartphone IVAs were unable to reliably recognize suicide-related queries, with answers not directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

With these past results in mind, not much confidence can really be placed in such technology.</p>\n<p>As a result, the authors of the current study wanted to provide more insight into use of the IVAs, and make an independent assessment of their usability and reliability.</p>\n<p>Results of their study indicate that only 4 of 70 user queries presented to 5 different IVAs led to a single response. The remainder of the responses led to confusion (e.g. &ldquo;did I say something wrong?&rdquo;). When Alexa was asked &ldquo;help me quit drugs&rdquo;, she answered with a definition for the word &ldquo;drugs&rdquo;. &ldquo;Help me quit&hellip;smoking&rdquo; or &ldquo;tobacco&rdquo; on Google Assistant (GA) returned &ldquo;Dr. QuitNow&rdquo; (a cessation app), while on Siri &ldquo;help me quit pot&rdquo; promoted a marijuana retailer. IVA responses to queries for other substances did not return any significantly different results.</p>\n<p>The results of this study make it clear that a consensus is required among public health leaders and tech companies when making resources available to queries related to substance use disorder. As the adoption of IVAs becomes more widespread, its imperative that they incorporate critical resources for persons suffering with addiction.</p>\n<p>The authors conclude that IVAs not only need technical improvements in voice recognition related to medical terminology, but stress that it&rsquo;s essential that they &ldquo;promote free, remote, federally sponsored addiction services, such as SAMSHA&rsquo;s 1-800-662-HELP helpline.
